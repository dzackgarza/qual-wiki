Let \(G\) be a group. An automorphism \(\phi: G \rightarrow G\) is
called \emph{inner} if the automorphism is given by conjugation by a
fixed group element \(g\), i.e.,
\begin{align*}
\phi=\phi_{g}: h \mapsto g h g^{-1} .
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Prove that the set of inner automorphisms forms a normal subgroup of
  the group of all automorphisms of \(G\).
\item
  Give an example of a finite group with an automorphism which is not
  inner.
\item
  Denote by \(S_{n}\) the group of permutations of the set
  \(\{1, \ldots, n\}\). Suppose that \(g \in S_{n}\) sends \(i\) to
  \(g_{i}\) for \(i=1, \ldots, n .\) Let \((a, b)\) denote as usual the
  cycle notation for the transposition which permutes \(a\) and \(b\).
  For \(i \in\{1, \ldots, n-1\}\), compute \(\phi_{g}((i, i+1))\).
\item
  Suppose that an automorphism
  \(\phi \in \operatorname{Aut}\left(S_{n}\right)\) preserves cycle
  type, i.e., that for every element \(s\) of \(S_{n}, s\) and
  \(\phi(s)\) have the same cycle type. Show that \(\phi\) is inner.
