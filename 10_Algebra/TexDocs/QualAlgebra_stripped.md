# Group Theory: General

## Permutations

### Fall 2021 \#1 \

Let \( G \) be a group. An automorphism \( \phi: G \rightarrow G \) is called *inner* if the automorphism is given by conjugation by a fixed group element \( g \), i.e.,
\[
\phi=\phi_{g}: h \mapsto g h g^{-1} .
\]

a.  Prove that the set of inner automorphisms forms a normal subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of \( G \).

b.  Give an example of a finite group with an automorphism which is not inner.

c.  Denote by \( S_{n} \) the group of permutations of the set \( \{1, \ldots, n\} \). Suppose that \( g \in S_{n} \) sends \( i \) to \( g_{i} \) for \( i=1, \ldots, n . \) Let \( (a, b) \) denote as usual the cycle notation for the transposition which permutes \( a \) and \( b \). For \( i \in\{1, \ldots, n-1\} \), compute \( \phi_{g}((i, i+1)) \).

d.  Suppose that an automorphism \( \phi \in \operatorname{Aut}\left(S_{n}\right) \) preserves cycle type, i.e., that for every element \( s \) of \( S_{n}, s \) and \( \phi(s) \) have the same cycle type. Show that \( \phi \) is inner.

> Hint: Consider the images of generators \( \phi((1,2)), \phi((2,3)), \cdots, \phi((n-1, n)) \).

## Cosets

### Spring 2020 \#2 \

Let \( H \) be a normal subgroup of a finite group \( G \) where the order of \( H \) and the index of \( H \) in \( G \) are relatively prime. Prove that no other subgroup of \( G \) has the same order as \( H \).

:::

::: {.strategy}
Recognize that it suffices to show \( hN = N \). Context cue: coprimality hints at division algorithm. Descend to quotient so you can leverage both the order of \( h \) *and* the order of cosets simultaneously.

-   For ease of notation, replace \( H \) in the problem with \( N \) so we remember which one is normal.
-   Write \( n\coloneqq{\sharp}N \) and \( m \coloneqq[G:N] = {\sharp}G/N \), where the quotient makes sense since \( N \) is normal.
-   Let \( H \leq G \) with \( {\sharp}H = n \), we'll show \( H=N \).
    -   Since \( {\sharp}H = {\sharp}N \) it suffices to show \( H \subseteq N \).
    -   It further suffices to show \( hN = N \) for all \( h\in H \).
-   Noting \( \gcd(m, n)=1 \), use the division algorithm to write \( 1 = ns + mt \) for some \( s,t\in {\mathbb{Z}} \).
-   The result follows from a computation:
    \[
    hN 
    &= h^1 N \\
    &= h^{ns + mt}N \\
    &= h^{ns} N \cdot h^{mt}N \\
    &= \qty{h^n N}^s \cdot \qty{h^t N}^m \\
    &= (eN)^s \cdot N \\
    &= N
    ,\]
    -   We've used that \( h\in H \implies o(h) \divides {\sharp}H = n \) by Lagrange, so \( h^n = e \).
    -   We've also used that \( {\sharp}G/N = m \), so \( (xH)^m = H \) for any \( xH\in G/H \).

### Fall 2014 \#6 \

Let \( G \) be a group and \( H, K < G \) be subgroups of finite index. Show that
\[
[G: H\cap K] \leq [G: H] ~ [G:K]
.\]

-   \( H \cap K \leq H \leq G \implies [G: H \cap K] = [G: H] [H : H \cap K] \)
-   So it suffices to show \( [H: H \cap K] \leq [G: K] \)
-   Write \( H/H \cap K = \left\{{ h_1 J, \cdots, h_m J }\right\} \) as distinct cosets where \( J \coloneqq H \cap J \).
-   Then \( h_i J\neq h_j J \iff h_i h_j^{-1}\not\in J = H \cap K \).
-   \( H \) is a subgroup, so \( h_i h_j^{-1}\in H \) forces this not to be in \( K \).
-   But then \( h_i K \neq h_j K \), so these are distinct cosets in \( G/K \).
-   So \( {\sharp}G/K \geq m \).
:::

### Spring 2013 \#3 \

Let \( P \) be a finite \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group. Prove that every nontrivial normal subgroup of \( P \) intersects the center of \( P \) nontrivially.

```{=tex}
\todo[inline]{Clean up, sketchy argument.}
```
::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   Let \( N{~\trianglelefteq~}P \), then for each conjugacy class \( [n_i] \) in \( N \), \( H \cap[g_i] = [g_i] \) or is empty.
-   \( G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{i\leq M} [g_i] \) is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes, and the conjugacy classes of \( H \) are of the form \( [g_i] \cap H \).
-   Then pull out the center
    \[
    H = \displaystyle\coprod_{i\leq M} [g_i] \cap H = \qty{ Z(G) \cap H } {\textstyle\coprod}\displaystyle\coprod_{i\leq M'} [g_i]
    .\]
-   Taking cardinalities,
    \[
    {\sharp}H = {\sharp}\qty{ Z(G) \cap H} + \sum_{i\leq M'} {\sharp}[g_i]
    .\]
-   \( p \) divides \( H \) since \( H\leq P \) and \( P \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group.
-   Each \( {\sharp}[g_i] \geq 2 \) since the trivial conjugacy classes appear in the center, forcing \( {\sharp}[g_i] \geq p \).
-   \( p \) divides \( {\sharp}[g_i] \) since \( {\sharp}[g_i] \) must divide \( {\sharp}P = p^k \)
-   So \( p \) must divide the remaining term \( Z(G) \cap H \), which makes it nontrivial.

## Burnside / Class Equation

### Spring 2019 \#4 \

For a finite group \( G \), let \( c(G) \) denote the number of conjugacy classes of \( G \).

a.  Prove that if two elements of \( G \) are chosen uniformly at random,then the probability they commute is precisely
    \[
    \frac{c(G)}{{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert}}
    .\]

b.  State the class equation for a finite group.

c.  Using the class equation (or otherwise) show that the probability in part (a) is at most
    \[
    \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 {2[G : Z(G)]}
    .\]

> Here, as usual, \( Z(G) \) denotes the center of \( G \).

Fixed points of the conjugation action are precisely commuting elements. Apply Burnside. Context clue: \( 1/[G:Z(G)] \) is weird, right? Use that \( [G:Z(G)] = {\sharp}G/{\sharp}Z(G) \), so try to look for \( {\sharp}Z(G)/{\sharp}(G) \) somewhere. Count sizes of centralizers.

-   Define a sample space \( \Omega = G \times G \), so \( {\sharp}{\Omega} = ({\sharp}{G})^2 \).

-   Identify the event we want to analyze:
    \[
    A \coloneqq\left\{{(g,h) \in G\times G {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}[g,h] = 1}\right\} \subseteq \Omega
    .\]

-   Note that the slices are centralizers:
    \[
    A_g \coloneqq\left\{{(g, h) \in \left\{{ g }\right\} \times G {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}[g, h] = 1}\right\} = Z(g) \implies A = \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} Z(g)
    .\]

-   Set \( n \) be the number of conjugacy classes, note we want to show \( P(A) = n / {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} \).

-   Let \( G \) act on itself by conjugation, which partitions \( G \) into conjugacy classes.

    -   What are the orbits?
        \[
        \mathcal{O}_g = \left\{{hgh^{-1}{~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}h\in G}\right\}
        ,\]
        which is the **conjugacy class** of \( g \). In particular, the number of orbits is the number of conjugacy classes.

    -   What are the fixed points?
        \[X^g = \left\{{h\in G {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}hgh^{-1}= g}\right\},\]
        which are the elements of \( G \) that commute with \( g \), which is isomorphic to \( A_g \).

-   Identifying centralizers with fixed points,
    \[
    {\sharp}{A} = {\sharp}{\displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} Z(g) } = \sum_{g\in G} {\sharp}{Z(g)} = \sum_{g\in G}{\sharp}{X^g}
    .\]

-   Apply Burnside
    \[
    {\sharp}{X / G} = \frac { 1 } { {\sharp}G  } \sum _ { g \in G } {\sharp}X ^ { g } ,
    \]

-   Note \( {\sharp}{X/G} = n \), i.e.Â the number of conjugacy classes is the number of orbits.

-   Rearrange and use definition:
    \[
    n \cdot {\sharp}{G}
    = \qty{{\sharp}{X/G} }\cdot {\sharp}{G}
    = \sum _ { g \in G } {\sharp}X ^ { g } 
    \]

-   Compute probability:
    \[
    P(A)
    = {{\sharp}A \over {\sharp}\Omega} 
    =  \displaystyle\sum _{ g \in G } \frac{{\sharp}X ^ { g }}{ ( {\sharp}{G} )^2} 
    = \frac{\qty{ {\sharp}{X/G}} \cdot {\sharp}{G}}{ ({\sharp}{G})^2} 
    = \frac{n \cdot {\sharp}{G}}{( {\sharp}{G} )^2} 
    = \frac n {{\sharp}G}

> (DZG): I couldn't convince myself that a previous proof using the class equation actually works. Instead, I'll borrow the proof from [this note](https://math.berkeley.edu/~tb65536/Commuting_Probability.pdf)

-   Write the event as \( A = \displaystyle\coprod_{g\in G} \left\{{g}\right\} \times Z(g) \), then

    = {{\sharp}A\over ({\sharp}G)^2}

    .\]
-   Attempt to estimate the sum: pull out central elements \( g\in Z(G) \).
    -   Note \( Z(g) = G \) for central \( g \), so \( {\sharp}Z(g) = {\sharp}G \)
    -   Note
        \[
        g\not\in Z(G)\implies {\sharp}Z(g) \leq {1\over 2} {\sharp}G
        ,\]
        since \( Z(g) \leq G \) is a subgroup, and
        \[
        [G:Z(g)] \neq 1 \implies [G: Z(g)] \geq 2
        .\]
-   Use these facts to calculate:
    \[
    P(A) 
    &= {1\over ({\sharp}G)^2 } \qty{ \sum_{g\in Z(g)} {\sharp}Z(g) + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {\sharp}Z(g) } \\

    &= {1\over ({\sharp}G) } \qty{ {\sharp}Z(G) + \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} {1\over 2} } \\
    &= {1\over ({\sharp}G) } \qty{ {\sharp}Z(G) + {1\over 2} \sum_{g\not\in Z(g)} 1 } \\
    &= {1\over ({\sharp}G) } \qty{ {\sharp}Z(G) + {1\over 2} {\sharp}(G \setminus Z(G) ) } \\
    &= {1\over ({\sharp}G) } \qty{ {\sharp}Z(G) + {1\over 2} {\sharp}G - {1\over 2} {\sharp}Z(G) } \\

## Group Actions / Representations

### Spring 2017 \#1 \

Let \( G \) be a finite group and \( \pi: G\to \operatorname{Sym}(G) \) the Cayley representation.

> (Recall that this means that for an element \( x\in G \), \( \pi(x) \) acts by left translation on \( G \).)

Prove that \( \pi(x) \) is an odd permutation \( \iff \) the order \( {\left\lvert {\pi(x)} \right\rvert} \) of \( \pi(x) \) is even and \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} / {\left\lvert {\pi(x)} \right\rvert} \) is odd.

::: {.warnings}
(DZG): This seems like an unusually hard group theory problem. My guess is this year's qual class spent more time than usual on the proof of Cayley's theorem.
:::

::: {.concept}
```{=tex}

-   \( \operatorname{Sym}(G) \coloneqq\mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}_{\mathsf{Set}}(G, G) \) is the group of set morphisms from \( G \) to itself, i.e.Â permutations of elements of \( G \).
-   More standard terminology: this is related to the **left regular representation** where \( g\mapsto \phi_g \) where \( \phi_g(x) = gx \), regarded instead as a permutation representation.
    -   This action is transitive!
-   Cayley's theorem: every \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group. In particular, take \( \left\{{ \phi_g {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}G\in G }\right\} \) with function composition as a subgroup of \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}_{\mathsf{Set}}(G) \).
:::

> (DZG): Warning!! I haven't checked this solution very carefully, and this is kind of a delicate parity argument. Most of the key ideas are borrowed [from here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3028603/show-that-phig-is-an-even-permutation).

-   Write \( k \coloneqq o(\pi_g) \), then since \( \pi \) is injective, \( k = o(g) \) in \( G \).
-   Since \( \pi_g \) as a cycle is obtained from the action of \( g \), we can pick an element \( x_0 \) in \( G \), take the orbit under the action, and obtain a cycle of length \( k \) since the order of \( g \) is \( k \). Then continue by taking any \( x_1 \) not in the first orbit and taking *its* orbit. Continuing this way exhausts all group elements and yields a decomposition into disjoint cycles:
    \[
    \pi_g = 
    (x_0, gx_0, g^2 x_0, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_0)
    (x_1, gx_1, g^2 x_1, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_1)
    \cdots
    (x_m, gx_m, g^2 x_m, \cdots, g^{k-1} x_m)
    .\]
-   So there are \( m \) orbits all of length exactly \( k \). Proceed by casework.
-   If \( k \) is even:
    -   This yields \( m \) odd cycles, and thus \( \pi \) has zero (an even number) of even cycles.
    -   Thus \( \pi \in \ker \operatorname{sgn} \) and is an even permutation.
-   If \( k \) is odd
    -   This yields \( m \) even cycles, thus an even number of even cycles iff \( m \) is even
-   The claim is that the number of orbit representatives \( m \) is equal to \( [G:H] = {\sharp}G/H \) for \( H = \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle \).
    -   Proof: define a map
        \[
        \left\{{ \text{Orbit representatives } x_i }\right\} &\to G/H \\
        x &\mapsto xH
        .\]
    -   This is injective and surjective because
        \[
        xH = yH &\iff xy^{-1}\in H = \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle \\
        &\iff xy^{-1}= g^\ell \\
        &\iff x=g^\ell y \\
        &\iff y\in {\mathcal{O}}_x
        ,\]
        so \( y \) and \( x \) are in the same orbit and have the same orbit representative.
-   We now have
    \[
    \pi_g \text{ is an even permutation } \iff 
    \begin{cases}
    k \text{ is odd and } m \text{ is even} &  
    \\
    \text{ or } & \\
    k \text{ is even}
     & .
    \end{cases}
    \]
-   Everything was an iff, so flip the evens to odds:
    \[
    \pi_g \text{ is an odd permutation } \iff 
    \begin{cases}
    k \text{ is even and } m \text{ is odd} &  
    \\
    \text{ or } & \\
    k \text{ is odd}
     & .
    \end{cases}
    .\]
-   Then just recall that \( k\coloneqq o(\pi_g) \) and
    \[
    m= [G: \left\langle{ g }\right\rangle] = {\sharp}G / {\sharp}\left\langle{ g }\right\rangle= {\sharp}G / o(g) = {\sharp}G/ o(\pi_g)
    .\]

-   \( x\in Z(G) \) iff \( {\sharp}C_x = 1 \), i.e.Â the size of its conjugacy class is one.

    -   In fact, this is a characterization of normal subgroups (i.e.Â \( H \) is normal iff \( H \) is a union of conjugacy classes in \( G \)).
    -   Why: if \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \) then \( ghg^{-1}\in H \) for all \( g \), so \( C_h \subseteq H \) and \( \displaystyle\bigcup_h C_h = H \). Conversely, if \( H = \displaystyle\bigcup_{h\in H} C_h \), then \( ghg^{-1}\in C_h \subseteq H \) and thus \( gHg^{-1}= H \).
-   Orbit stabilizer theorem: \( {\sharp}C_g = {\sharp}G/ {\sharp}K_g \) where \( C_g \) is the centralizer and \( K_g \) is the conjugacy class of \( g \).

-   Let \( p \coloneqq{\sharp}H \).

-   Let \( \left\{{ C_i }\right\}_{i\leq n} \) be the conjugacy classes in \( G \), then \( G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{i\leq n} C_i \)

-   By the first fact, there is a sub-collection \( \left\{{ C_{i_j}}\right\}_{j\leq k } \) such that
    \[
    H = {\textstyle\coprod}_{j\leq k} C_{i_j}
    .\]

-   The identity is always in a single conjugacy class, so \( C_e = \left\{{ e }\right\} \).

-   Since \( e\in H \), without loss of generality, label \( C_{i_1} = \left\{{ e }\right\} \).

-   So
    \[
    H 
    = \displaystyle\coprod_{j\leq k} C_{i_j} 
    = C_{i_1}{\textstyle  \coprod} \displaystyle\displaystyle\coprod_{\substack{ j\leq k \\ j\neq 1} } C_{i_j} 
    .\]

-   Take cardinality in the above equation
    \[
    p = 1 + \sum_{\substack{ j\leq k \\ j\neq 1 }} {\sharp}C_{i_j}
    .\]

-   So \( {\sharp}C_{i_j} \leq p-1 \) for all \( j\neq 1 \).

-   Every \( {\sharp}C_{i_j} \) divides \( {\sharp}G \), but \( p \) was the *minimal* prime dividing \( {\sharp}G \), forcing \( {\sharp}C_{i_j} = 1 \) for all \( j \neq 1 \).

    -   This rules out \( {\sharp}C_{i_j} \) being a prime less than \( p \), but also rules out composites: if a prime \( q\divides {\sharp}C_{i_j} \), then \( q<p \) and \( q\divides {\sharp}G \), a contradiction.

Give generators and relations for the non-commutative group \( G \) of order 63 containing an element of order \( 9 . \)

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}

-   Idea: take a semidirect product involving \( C_9 \) and \( C_7 \). We'll need some facts: \( \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(C_m, C_n) \cong C_d \) where \( d = \gcd(m, n) \), and \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_m)\cong C_m^{\times} \) which has order \( \phi(m) \) (since one needs to send generators to generators), which can be explicitly calculated based on the prime factorization of \( m \).

-   Some calculations we'll need:

    -   \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_9) \cong C_9^{\times}\cong C_{\phi(9)} \cong C_6 \), using that \( \phi(p^k) = p^{k-1}(p-1) \).
    -   \( \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_7) \cong C_7^{\times}\cong C_{\phi(7)}\cong C_6 \) using that \( \phi(p) = p-1 \).

-   To get a nonabelian group, we need a nontrivial semidirect product, so look at \( \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(G, \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(H)) \) in the two possible combinations.

    -   \( \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(C_7, \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_9)) \cong \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(C_7, C_6) \cong C_1 \coloneqq\left\{{e}\right\} \) using that \( \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(C_m, C_n) \cong C_{d} \) for \( d = \gcd(m, n) \). So there are no nontrivial homs here, so only the direct product is possible.
    -   \( \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(C_9, \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_7)) \cong \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(C_9, C_6) \cong C_3 \), so use this!
    -   Note that we don't have to consider possibilities for \( C_3\times C_3 \), since including this as a factor would yield no elements of order 9.

-   So take \( G\coloneqq C_7 \rtimes_\psi C_9 \) for some \( \psi: C_9 \to \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(C_7) \), and we can take the presentation
    \[
    G = \left\langle{x, y{~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}x^7, y^9, yxy^{-1}= \psi(x)}\right\rangle
    .\]

-   It now suffices to find a nontrivial \( \psi: C_7\to C_7 \). Writing it multiplicatively as \( C_7 = \left\langle{x{~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}x^7}\right\rangle \), any map that sends \( x \) to a generator will do. It suffices to choose any \( k \) coprime to \( 7 \), and then take \( \psi(x) \coloneqq x^k \), which will be another generator.

-   So take

\[
G = \left\langle{x, y{~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}x^7, y^9, yxy^{-1}= x^2}\right\rangle
.\]

Let \( G \) be a nonabelian group of order \( p^3 \) for \( p \) prime. Show that \( Z(G) = [G, G] \).

> Note: this is a good problem, it tests several common theorems at once. Proof due to Paco Adajar.

::: {.concept}

Important notations and definitions:

-   The **center** of \( G \), denoted by \( Z(G) \), is the subset of elements of \( G \) which commute with all elements of \( G \). That is, if \( x \in Z(G) \), then for all \( g \in G \), \( gx = xg \):
    \[Z(G) = \{ x \in G : gx = xg \, \text{for all } g \in G \}.\]

    In fact, \( Z(G) \) is not just a subset of \( G \), but a normal subgroup of \( G \).

-   The **commutator subgroup** of \( G \), denoted by \( [G, G] \), is the subgroup of \( G \) generated by the commutators of \( G \), i.e., the elements of the form \( ghg^{-1}h^{-1} \):
    \[[G, G] = \langle ghg^{-1}h^{-1} : g, h \in G \rangle.\]

    The commutator subgroup \( [G,G] \) is the smallest normal subgroup of \( G \) whose quotient is abelian. That is, if \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \) for which \( G/H \) is abelian, then \( [G, G] \le H \).

    Moreover, \( G \) is abelian if and only if \( [G,G] \) is trivial.

Theorems to remember and know how to prove:

-   **\( G/Z(G) \) Theorem**: If \( G/Z(G) \) is cyclic, then \( G \) is abelian, i.e., \( G/Z(G) \) is in fact trivial.

-   **Lagrange's Theorem**: If \( G \) is a group of finite order and \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \), then the order of \( H \) divides that of \( G \).

    -   One consequence of this is that every group of prime order is cyclic.

-   A \( p \)-group (a group of order \( p^n \) for some prime \( p \) and some positive integer \( n \)) has nontrivial center.

-   A consequence of the theorems above: every group of order \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is prime) is abelian.
:::

::: {.solution}
Since \( Z(G) \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( |G| = p^3 \), by Lagrange's theorem, \( |Z(G)| \in \{1, p, p^2, p^3\} \).

Since we stipulated that \( G \) is nonabelian, \( |Z(G)| \ne p^3 \). Also, since \( G \) is a \( p \)-group, it has nontrivial center, so \( |Z(G)| \ne 1 \). Finally, by the \( G/Z(G) \) theorem, \( |Z(G)| \ne p^2 \): if \( |Z(G)| = p^2 \), then \( |G/Z(G)| = p \) and so \( G/Z(G) \) would be cyclic, meaning that \( G \) is abelian. Hence, \( |Z(G)| = p \).

Then, since \( |Z(G)| = p \), we have that \( |G/Z(G)| = p^2 \), and so \( G/Z(G) \) is abelian. Thus, \( [G, G] \in Z(G) \). Since \( |Z(G)| = p \), then \( |[G,G]| \in \{ 1, p\} \) again by Lagrange's theorem. If \( |[G,G]| = p \) then \( [G,G] = Z(G) \) and we are done. And, indeed, we must have \( |[G,G]| = p \), because \( G \) is nonabelian and so \( |[G,G]| \ne 1 \).

-   By definition, \( S\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \iff S \) is a *maximal* \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup: \( S<G \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)group, so \( {\sharp}S = p^k \) for some \( k \), \( S \) is a proper subgroup, and \( S \) is maximal in the sense that there are no proper \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroups \( S' \) with \( S \subseteq S' \subseteq G \).
-   Since \( {\sharp}H = p^i \), \( H \) is a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup of \( G \).
-   If \( H \) is maximal, then by definition \( H\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \)
-   Otherwise, if \( H \) is not maximal, there exists an \( H' \supseteq H \) with \( H'\leq G \) a \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup properly containing \( H \).
    -   In this apply the same argument to \( H' \): this yields a proper superset containment at every stage, and since \( G \) is finite, there is no infinite ascending chain of proper supersets.
    -   So this terminates in some maximal \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup \( S \), i.e.Â a Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup.
-   So \( H \subseteq S \) for some \( S\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \).
-   All Sylows are conjugate, so for any \( S' \in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \) we can write \( S' = gSg^{-1} \) for some \( g \).
-   Then using that \( H \) is normal, \( H \subseteq S \implies H = gHg^{-1}\subseteq gSg^{-1}\coloneqq S' \). So \( H \) is contained in every Sylow \( p{\hbox{-}} \)subgroup.

-   Note \( \left\langle{ab, b}\right\rangle \subseteq \left\langle{a, b}\right\rangle \), since any finite word in \( ab, b \) is also a finite word in \( a, b \).

-   Since \( (ab)b = ab^2 = a \), we have \( \left\langle{ab, b}\right\rangle \subseteq \left\langle{a, b}\right\rangle \), so \( \left\langle{ab, b}\right\rangle = \left\langle{a, b}\right\rangle \).

-   Define
    \[
    \psi: F(r, s) &\to G \\
    r &\mapsto ab \\
    t &\mapsto b

-   This is clearly surjective since it hits all generators.

-   We'll show that \( ab, a \) satisfy all of the relations defining \( D_{2n} \), which factors \( \psi \) through \( \ker \pi \), yielding a surjection \( \tilde \psi: D_{2n} \twoheadrightarrow G \).

    -   \( (ab)^n = e \) by construction, \( b^2 = e \) by assumption, and

        b (ab) b^{-1}= babb^{-1}= ba = b^{-1}a^{-1}= (ab)^{-1}

        corresponding to the relation \( srs^{-1}= r^{-1} \). Here we've used that \( o(a) = o(b) = 2 \) implies \( a=a^{-1}, b=b^{-1} \).

-   Surjectivity of \( \tilde \psi \) yields \( 2n = {\sharp}D_{2n} \geq {\sharp}G \).

-   The claim is that \( {\sharp}G \geq 2n \), which forces \( {\sharp}G = 2n \). Then \( \tilde \psi \) will be a surjective group morphism between groups of the same order, and thus an isomorphism.

    -   We have \( \left\langle{ ab }\right\rangle\leq G \), so \( n\divides {\sharp}G \).
    -   Since \( b\not\in \left\langle{ ab }\right\rangle \), this forces \( {\sharp}G > n \), so \( {\sharp}G \geq 2n \).

    -   Using that \( [n_q]_q \equiv 1 \), consider reducing \( \left\{{1, p, p^2}\right\}\operatorname{mod}q \).

    -   Since now \( p<q \), we have \( p\operatorname{mod}q = p \) itself, so \( p\operatorname{mod}q \neq 1 \) and we can rule it out.

    -   The remaining possibility is \( n_q = p^2 \).

        \[
        \text{Elements from Sylow } p: n_p( {\sharp}S_p - 1) &= q(p^2-1) 
        .\]
        Then we get a count of how many elements the Sylow \( p \)s and \( q \)s contribute:
        \[
        q(p^2-1) + p^2(q-1) + 1
        = p^2q - q + p^2q - p^2 + 1 
        = p^2q + (p^2-1)(q-1)
        > p^2q = {\sharp}G
        ,\]
        provided \( (p^2-1)(q-1) \neq 0 \), which is fine for \( p\geq 2 \) since this is at least \( (2^2-1)(3-2) = 3 \) (since \( p<q \) and \( q=3 \) is the next smallest prime). \( \contradiction \)

    -   Otherwise, we get two Sylow \( p \)s intersecting nontrivially, which must be in a subgroup of order at least \( p \) since the intersection is a subgroup of both. In this case, just considering these two subgroups, we get
        \[
        \text{Elements from Sylow } p: n_p( {\sharp}S_p - 1) &> p^2 + p^2 - p = 2p^2-p -1
        .\]
        Then a count:
        \[
        p^2(q-1) + (2p^2-p - 1) + 1
        &= p^2 q- p^2 + 2p^2 -p \\

-   Let \( G\curvearrowright X \) transitively where \( {\left\lvert {X} \right\rvert} \geq 2 \).
-   An action is transitive iff there is only one orbit, so \( {\left\lvert {X/G} \right\rvert} = 1 \).
-   Apply Burnside's Lemma
    \[
    1 = {\left\lvert {X/G} \right\rvert} = \frac{1}{{\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert}} \sum_{g\in G} {\left\lvert { \mathrm{Fix} (g)} \right\rvert} \implies {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} = \sum_{g\in G} {\left\lvert { \mathrm{Fix} (g)} \right\rvert} =  \mathrm{Fix} (e) + \sum_{\substack{g\in G \\ g\neq e}} {\left\lvert { \mathrm{Fix} (g)} \right\rvert}

-   Note that \(  \mathrm{Fix} (e) = X \), since the identity must fix every element, so \( {\left\lvert { \mathrm{Fix} (e)} \right\rvert} \geq 2 \).
-   If \( {\left\lvert { \mathrm{Fix} (g)} \right\rvert} > 0 \) for all \( g\neq e \), the remaining term is at least \( {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} -1 \). But then the right-hand side yields is at least \( 2 + ({\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} -1) = {\left\lvert {G} \right\rvert} + 1 \), contradicting the equality.
-   So not every \( {\left\lvert { \mathrm{Fix} (g)} \right\rvert} > 0 \), and \( {\left\lvert {  \mathrm{Fix} (g) } \right\rvert} = 0 \) for some \( g \), which says \( g \) has no fixed points in \( X \).

-   \( R \) is Euclidean iff it admits a Euclidean algorithm: there is a degree function \( f: R\to {\mathbb{Z}}_{\geq 0} \) such that for all \( a,b\in R \), there exist \( q, r\in R \) such that \( a = bq + r \) where \( f(r) <f(b) \) or \( r=0 \).

-   \( R \) is a UFD iff every \( r\in R \) can be written as \( r = u \prod_{i=1}^n p_i \) with \( n\geq 0 \), \( u\in R^{\times} \), and \( p_i \) irreducible. This is unique up to associates of the \( p_i \) and reordering.

-   Euclidean implies UFD:

    -   Euclidean implies PID:
        -   If \( I \in \operatorname{Id}(R) \) one can use the degree function to find any \( b \in I \) where \( f(b) \) is minimal.
        -   Then \( I = \left\langle{b}\right\rangle \), since if \( a\in I \) one can write \( a = bq + r \) and use that \( a-bq \in I \implies r\in I \).
        -   But by minimality, we can't have \( f(r)<f(b) \), so \( r=0 \) and \( a \divides b \), so \( b\in \left\langle{a}\right\rangle \).
    -   PID implies UFD:
        -   Use that irreducible implies prime in a PID, so every \( x\in R \) has some factorization into finitely many primes.
        -   Supposing \( x = u_p \prod_{i=1}^m p_i = u_q \prod_{i=1}^n q_i \), use that \( p_1 \) divides the LHS and so \( p_1 \) divides the RHS. WLOG, \( p_1\divides q_1 \), so \( q_1 = u_1 p_1 \) for \( u\in R^{\times} \), so \( x = u_q u_1 p_1 \prod_{i=2}^m q_i \) by rewriting a term on the RHS.
        -   Note that this makes \( p_1, q_1 \) associates.
        -   Continuing up to \( m \), we get
            \[
            x 
            &= u_p \prod_{i=1}^m p_i \\
            &= 
            u_q \prod_{i=1}^m u_i p_i \prod_{k=m+1}^n q_i \\
            \implies 
            u_p 
            &= u_q \prod_{i=1}^m u_i \prod_{k=m+1}^n q_i \\
            \tilde u 
            &= \prod_{k=m+1}^n q_i
            ,\]
            where we've moved all units to the LHS. This makes \( p_i, q_i \) associates for \( i\leq m \).
        -   But primes aren't units and the product of nontrivial primes can't be a unit, so the right-hand side product must be empty.
        -   So \( m=n \) and all \( p_i, q_i \) are associate, QED.

-   UFD does not imply Euclidean:

    -   It suffices to find a UFD that is not a PID.
    -   Take \( R \coloneqq{\mathbb{C}}[x, y] \), which is a UFD by the usual factorization of polynomials. It is not a PID, since \( \left\langle{2, x}\right\rangle \) is not principal.

### Fall 2017 \#6 \

For a ring \( R \), let \( U(R) \) denote the multiplicative group of units in \( R \). Recall that in an integral domain \( R \), \( r \in R \) is called *irreducible* if \( r \) is not a unit in R, and the only divisors of \( r \) have the form \( ru \) with \( u \) a unit in \( R \).

We call a non-zero, non-unit \( r \in R \) *prime* in \( R \) if \( r \divides ab \implies r \divides a \) or \( r \divides b \). Consider the ring \( R = \{a + b \sqrt{-5}{~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}a, b \in Z\} \).

a.  Prove \( R \) is an integral domain.

b.  Show \( U(R) = \{\pm1\} \).

-   \( R \) is an integral domain:
    -   Let \( \alpha = a + b\sqrt{-5} \) and \( \beta = c + d \sqrt{-5} \) and set \( \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu\alpha\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu, \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu\beta\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \) be their conjugates.
    -   Then
        \[
        0 = \alpha \beta = \alpha\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu\alpha \mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu\beta\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu\beta \mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu= (a^2-5b^2)(c^2-5d^2) \in {\mathbb{Z}}
        ,\]
        so one factor is zero.
    -   If \( a^2 = 5b^2 \) then \( a = \sqrt{5} b \not\in {\mathbb{Z}} \) unless \( a=b=0 \). Otherwise, the same argument forces \( c=d=0 \).
-   The units are \( \pm 1 \):
    -   Use that \( u\in R^{\times}\implies N(u) = \pm 1 \), and \( N(\alpha) = \alpha \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu\alpha \mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu= (a+b\sqrt{-5})(a-b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2 = 1 \) forces \( b=0 \) and \( a=\pm 1 \).
-   Irreducible elements:
    -   \( 2, 3 \) are irreducible because if (say) \( 3=xy \) then \( N(x)N(y) = N(3) = 9 \), and if neither \( x,y \) are units then \( N(x) = N(y) = 3 \). But \( N(a + b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2 \) and \( a^2 + 5b^2 = 3 \) has no solutions. The same argument works for \( 2 \).
    -   \( 2\pm \sqrt{-5} \) are irreducible because \( N(2 + \sqrt{-5}) = 2^2 + 5(1) = 9 \), and in fact \( N(2 - \sqrt{-5}) = 2^2 + 5(-1)^2 = 9 \). By the same argument as above, this forces irreducibility.
-   \( 3 \) is not prime:
    -   We can write \( 6 = (3)(2) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5}) \), so if we assume \( 3 \) is prime we get \( 3\divides (1 \pm \sqrt{-5}) \).
    -   But writing \( (1\pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3r \) for some \( r\in R \) yields
        \[
        (1 \pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3(a + b\sqrt{-5}) \implies 3a=1, 3b = \pm 1
        .\]
        These have no solutions \( a, b\in {\mathbb{Z}} \). \( \contradiction \)
-   \( R \) is not a PID:
    -   Use that irreducibles are prime in a UFD, which is not true here.

-   Use the fact \( x\in \mathfrak N(R) \implies x^n = 0 \implies 1 + rx \) is a unit \( \iff x\in J(R) \) by (b):
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-x)^k = \frac{1 - (-x)^n}{1- (-x)} = (1+x)^{-1}

\( J(R) \subseteq \mathfrak N(R) \):

-   Let \( x \in J(R) \setminus \mathfrak N(R) \).

-   Since \( R \) is finite, \( x^m = x \) for some \( m > 0 \).

-   Without loss of generality, we can suppose \( x^2 = x \) by replacing \( x^m \) with \( x^{2m} \).

-   If \( 1-x \) is not a unit, then \( \left\langle{1-x}\right\rangle \) is a nontrivial proper ideal, which by (a) is contained in some maximal ideal \( {\mathfrak{m}} \). But then \( x\in {\mathfrak{m}} \) and \( 1-x \in {\mathfrak{m}}\implies x + (1-x) = 1 \in {\mathfrak{m}} \), a contradiction.

-   Suppose \( c\coloneqq f(a)\neq 0 \), noting that \( c \) may not be positive.
-   By continuity, pick \( {\varepsilon} \) small enough so that \( {\left\lvert {x-a} \right\rvert}<{\varepsilon}\implies {\left\lvert {f(x) - f(a)} \right\rvert} < c/2 \). Since we're on the interval, we have \( f(x) \in (f(a) - c/2, f(a) + c/2) = (c/2, 3c/2) \) which is a ball of radius \( c/2 \) about \( c \), which thus doesn't intersect \( 0 \).
-   So \( f(x) \neq 0 \) on this ball, and \( g \coloneqq f^2 > 0 \) on it. Note that ideals are closed under products, so \( g\in I \)
-   Moreover \( f^2(x) \geq 0 \) since squares are non-negative, so \( g\geq 0 \) on \( [0, 1] \).

-   By contrapositive, suppose \( V(I)= \emptyset \), we'll show \( I \) contains a unit and thus \( I=R \).
-   For each fixed \( x\in [0, 1] \), since \( V(I) \) is empty there is some \( f_x \) such that \( f_x(x) \neq 0 \).
-   By (a), there is some \( g_x \) with \( g_x(x) > 0 \) on a neighborhood \( U_x\ni x \) and \( g_x \geq 0 \) everywhere.
-   Ranging over all \( x \) yields a collection \( \left\{{(g_x, U_x) {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}x\in [0, 1]}\right\} \) where \( \left\{{U_x}\right\}\rightrightarrows[0, 1] \).
-   By compactness there is a finite subcover, yielding a finite collection \( \left\{{(g_k, U_k)}\right\}_{k=1}^n \) for some \( n \).
-   Define the candidate unit as
    \[
    G(x) \coloneqq{1\over \sum_{k=1}^n g_k(x)}
    .\]
-   This is well-defined: fix an \( x \), then the denominator is zero at \( x \) iff \( g_k(x) = 0 \) for all \( k \). But since the \( U_k \) form an open cover, \( x\in U_\ell \) for some \( \ell \), and \( g_\ell > 0 \) on \( U_\ell \).
-   Since ideals are closed under sums, \( H\coloneqq{1\over G} \coloneqq\sum g_k \in I \). But \( H \) is clearly a unit since \( HG = \operatorname{id} \).

-   If \( I{~\trianglelefteq~}R \) is maximal, \( I\neq R \), and so by (b) we have \( V(I) \neq \emptyset \).
-   So there is some \( x_0\in[0, 1] \) with \( f(x_0) = 0 \) for all \( f\in I \).
-   Define \( {\mathfrak{m}}_{x_0} \coloneqq\left\{{f\in R {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}f(x_0) = 0}\right\} \), which is clearly an ideal.
    -   This is a proper ideal, since constant nonzero functions are continuous and thus in \( R \), not not \( {\mathfrak{m}}_{x_0} \).
-   We thus have \( I \subseteq {\mathfrak{m}}_{x_0} \), and by maximality they are equal.

## Zero Divisors and Nilpotents

### Spring 2014 \#5 \

Let \( R \) be a commutative ring and \( a\in R \). Prove that \( a \) is not nilpotent \( \iff \) there exists a commutative ring \( S \) and a ring homomorphism \( \phi: R\to S \) such that \( \phi(a) \) is a unit.

> Note: by definition, \( a \) is nilpotent \( \iff \) there is a natural number \( n \) such that \( a^n = 0 \).

::: {.solution}
\( \not A\implies \not B \):

-   Suppose \( a \) is nilpotent, so \( a^m = 0_R \), and suppose \( \phi: R\to S \) is a ring morphism.
-   Ring morphisms send zero to zero, so \( 0_S = \phi(0_R) = \phi(a^m) = \phi(a)^m \) and \( \phi(a) \) is nilpotent.
-   But nontrivial rings can't contain nilpotent units: if \( u \) is a unit and \( ut= 1 \) with \( u^k=0 \), then \( 1 = 1^k = (ut)^k = u^k t^k=0 \) and \( R=0 \).

\( A\implies B \):

-   If \( a \) is not nilpotent, localize at the infinite multiplicative subset \( A \coloneqq\left\{{1, a, a^2, \cdots}\right\} \) to obtain \( R \left[ { \scriptstyle { {A}^{-1}}  } \right] \). Since \( 0\not\in A \), this is not the zero ring.
-   By the universal property, there is a map \( \phi: R\to R \left[ { \scriptstyle { {A}^{-1}}  } \right] \), and the claim is that \( \phi(a) \) is a unit in \( R \left[ { \scriptstyle { {A}^{-1}}  } \right] \).
-   More directly, \( \phi(a) = [a/1] \in \left\{{p,q {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}p\in R, q\in A}\right\} \), which has inverse \( [a/1] \).

-   Write \( f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k \), and supposing it's a zero divisor choose \( g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^m b_k x^k \) of minimal degree so that \( g\neq 0, b_m\neq 0 \), and \( f(x)g(x) = 0 \).
-   The claim is that the top coefficient \( b_m \) will suffice.
-   Write the product:
    \[
    0 = f(x)g(x) 
    = (a_0 + \cdots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_n x^n)
    (b_0 + \cdots + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + b_m x^m)
    .\]
-   Equating coefficients, the coefficient for \( x^{m+n} \) must be zero, so (**importantly**) \( a_n b_m = 0 \).
    -   Since \( a_n b_m=0 \), consider \( a_ng(x) \). This has degree \( d_1 \leq m-1 \) but satisfies \( a_ng(x)f(x) = a_n(g(x)f(x)) = 0 \), so by minimality \( a_ng(x) = 0 \).
    -   This forces \( a_n b_0 = \cdots = a_n b_{m-1} = 0 \), so \( a_n \) annihilates all of the \( b_k \).
-   Now consider the coefficient of \( x^{m+n-1} \), given by \( a_{n-1}b_m + a_{n}b_{m-1} \).
    -   The second term \( a_n b_{m-1}=0 \) since \( a_n \) annihilates all \( b_k \), so (**importantly**) \( a_{n-1} b_m = 0 \).
    -   Considering now \( a_{n-1}g(x) \):
        -   The same argument shows this has degree \( d_2 \leq m-1 \) but \( a_{n-1}g(x)f(x) = 0 \), so \( a_{n-1}g(x) = 0 \).
        -   So \( a_{n-1} \) annihilates all \( b_k \), and allowing this process to continue inductively.
-   For good measure, the coefficient of \( x^{m+n-2} \) is \( a_{n-2}b_m + a_{n-1}b_{m-1} + a_{n}b_{m-2} \).
    -   Note that \( a_n, a_{n-1} \) annihilate all \( b_k \), so (**importantly**) \( a_{n-2} b_m=0 \), and so on.
-   Thus \( a_k b_m = 0 \) for all \( 0\leq k \leq n \), and by linearity and commutativity, we have
    \[
    b_m f(x) = b_m \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k = \sum_{k=0}^n (b_m a_k) x^k = 0

Let \( \phi_r(x) \coloneqq rx \) be the multiplication map.

-   Let \( x\in \ker \phi_r \coloneqq\left\{{x\in R {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}rx = 0}\right\} \).

-   Since \( R \) is commutative \( 0 = rx = xr \), and so \( r\in \ker \phi_x \), so \( \ker \phi_x \neq 0 \) and \( x \) is a zero divisor by definition.

-   Let \( y\in \operatorname{im}\phi_r \coloneqq\left\{{y \coloneqq rx {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}x\in R}\right\} \), we want to show \( \ker \phi_y \) is nontrivial by producing some \( z \) such that \( yz=0 \). Write \( y\coloneqq rx \) for some \( x\in R \).

-   Since \( r \) is a zero divisor, we can produce some \( z\neq 0 \in \ker \phi_r \), so \( rz = 0 \).

-   Now using that \( R \) is commutative, we can compute
    \[
    yz = (rx)z = (xr)z = x (rz) = x(0) = 0

-   Let \( Z \coloneqq\left\{{z_i}\right\}_{i=1}^n \) be the set of \( n \) zero divisors in \( R \).

-   Let \( \phi_i \) be the \( n \) maps \( x \mapsto z_i x \), and let \( K_i = \ker \phi_i \) be the corresponding kernels.

-   Fix an \( i \).

-   By (b), \( K_i \) consists of zero divisors, so
    \[
    {\left\lvert {K_i} \right\rvert} \leq n < \infty \quad \text{for each } i
    .\]

-   Now consider \( R/K_i \coloneqq\left\{{r + K_i}\right\} \).

-   By the first isomorphism theorem, \( R/K_i \cong \operatorname{im}\phi \), and by (b) every element in the image is a zero divisor, so
    \[
    [R: K_i] = {\left\lvert {R/K_i} \right\rvert} = {\left\lvert {\operatorname{im}\phi_i} \right\rvert} \leq n 
    .\]

-   But then
    \[
    {\left\lvert {R} \right\rvert} = [R:K_i]\cdot {\left\lvert {K_i} \right\rvert} \leq n\cdot n = n^2 
    .\]

::: {.proof title="of d"}
```{=tex}

```
-   By (c), if there are exactly 2 zero divisors then \( {\left\lvert {R} \right\rvert} \leq 4 \). Since every element in a finite ring is either a unit or a zero divisor, and \( {\left\lvert {R^{\times}} \right\rvert} \geq 2 \) since \( \pm 1 \) are always units, we must have \( {\left\lvert {R} \right\rvert} = 4 \).

-   Since the characteristic of a ring must divide its size, we have \( \operatorname{ch}R = 2 \) or \( 4 \).

-   Using the hint, we see that only \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \) has characteristic 4, which has exactly 2 zero divisors given by \( [0]_4 \) and \( [2]_4 \).

-   If \( R \) has characteristic 2, we can check the other 3 possibilities.

-   We can write \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t]/(t^2) = \left\{{a + bt {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}a,b\in {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)}\right\} \), and checking the multiplication table we have
    \[
    \begin{array}{c|cccc}
              & 0 & 1     & t & 1+t   \\ \hline
    0       & 0 & 0     & 0 & 0     \\ 
    1       & 0 & 1     & t & 1+t   \\ 
    t       & 0 & t     & \mathbf{0} & t    \\ 
    1 + t & 0 & 1+t & t & 1     \\ 
    \end{array}
    ,\]

    and so we find that \( t, 0 \) are the zero divisors.

-   In \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t]/(t^2 - t) \), we can check that \( t^2 = t \implies t t^2 = t^2 \implies t(t^2 + 1) = 0 \implies t(t+1) = 0 \), so both \( t \) and \( t+1 \) are zero divisors, along with zero, so this is not a possibility.

-   Similarly, in \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t]/(t^2 + t + 1) \), we can check the bottom-right corner of the multiplication table to find
    \[
    \left[\begin{array}{c|cc}
      & t     & 1 +t \\ \hline
    t & 1+t & 1 \\
    t & 1   & t \\
    \end{array}\right]
    ,\]

    and so this ring only has one zero divisor.

-   Thus the only possibilities are:
    \[
    R &\cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \\
    R &\cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(2)[t] / (t^2)
    .\]

## Zorn's Lemma

    By Zorn's lemma the set of ideals disjoint from \( S \) has a maximal element with respect to inclusion, say \( I \). In other words, \( I \) is disjoint from \( S \) and if \( J \) is any ideal disjoint from \( S \) with \( I\subseteq J \subseteq R \) then \( J=I \) or \( J=R \).

-   Apply Zorn's lemma: let \( C: C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots \) be a chain (totally ordered sub-poset) in \( S \). If \( C \) is the empty chain, \( K \) is an upper bound. Otherwise, if \( C \) is nonempty, define \( \widehat{C} \coloneqq\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty C_i \).

    -   \( \widehat{C} \) is an ideal: if \( a,b\in \widehat{C} \), then \( a\in C_i, b\in C_j \) for some \( i,j \). But without loss of generality, using that chains are totally ordered, \( C_i \subseteq C_j \), so \( a,b\in C_j \) and thus \( ab\in C_j \). Similarly for \( x\in \widehat{C} \), \( x\in C_j \) for some \( j \), and thus \( Rx \subseteq C_j \) since \( C_j \) is an ideal.

        -   That \( \widehat{C} \neq R \): an ideal equals \( R \) iff it contains a unit. But if \( r\in \widehat{C} \) is a unit, \( r\in C_j \) for some \( j \) is a unit, making \( C_j=R \). \( \contradiction \)

-   Applying Zorn's lemma, let \( C: C_1 \subseteq C_2 \subseteq \cdots \) be a chain and define \( \widehat{C} \coloneqq\cup C_i \).

    -   By contradiction, if so then \( 1 \in \widehat{C} \implies 1 \in C_j \) for some \( j \), forcing \( C_j = R \).

-   Produce elements \( x\coloneqq p_1 + r_1a, y\coloneqq p_2 + r_2b\in S \), then since \( S \) is multiplicatively closed,

-   Reduce to a group theory problem: \( [E:F] = [G:H] \), despite the fact that \( E/F \) is not necessarily Galois. This is because we can count in towers:
    \[
    [K:F] = [K:E][E:F] &\implies [G:1] = [K:E][H:1] \\
    &\implies {\sharp}G = [K:E] {\sharp}H \\
    &\implies [G:H] = {{\sharp}G \over {\sharp}H} = [K:E]
    .\]

-   Essential fact: if \( P \in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(G) \), we can use that \( P \subseteq N_G(P) \subset H \) and so \( P\in {\operatorname{Syl}}_p(H) \) as well.

-   Now use that \( N_G(P) \subseteq H \), and do Sylow theory for \( P \) in both \( G \) and \( H \):

    -   Sylow 3 on \( G \) yields \( n_p(G) = [G: N_G(P)] \equiv 1 \operatorname{mod}p \).
    -   Sylow 3 on \( H \) yields \( n_p(H) = [G: N_H(P)] \equiv 1 \operatorname{mod}p \).

-   Claim: \( N_H(P) = N_G(P) \).

    -   We have \( N_H(P) \subseteq N_G(P) \) since \( H \subseteq G \), so \( hPh^{-1}= P \) remains true regarding either \( h\in H \) or \( h\in G \).
    -   For \( N_G(P) \subseteq N_H(P) \), use that \( N_G(P) \subseteq H \) and so \( gPg^{-1}= P \) implies \( g\in H \), so \( g\in N_H(P) \).

-   Now morally one might want to apply an isomorphism theorem:
    \[
    {G/ N_G(P) \over H/N_H(P)}=
    {G/ N_H(P) \over H/N_H(P)}\cong
    {G\over H}
    ,\]
    but we don't have normality. However, we can still get away with the corresponding counting argument if everything is finite:
    \[
    {[G: N_G(P)] \over [H:N_H(P)] }=
    {[G: N_H(P)] \over [H:N_H(P)] }=
    {{\sharp}G / {\sharp}N_H(P) \over {\sharp}H / {\sharp}N_H(P)}
    = {{\sharp}G \over {\sharp}H} 
    = [G: H]
    .\]

-   We have an equation of the form \( n_p(G)/n_p(H) = m \), and we want to show \( m\equiv 1 \operatorname{mod}p \). So write
    \[
    {n_p(G) \over n_p(H) } 
    = m \implies m n_p(H) &= n_p(G) \\
    \implies m n_p(H) &\equiv n_p(G) \operatorname{mod}p \\
    \implies m\cdot 1 &\equiv 1 \operatorname{mod}p \\
    \implies m &\equiv 1 \operatorname{mod}p
    .\]

Let \( n\geq 3 \) and \( \zeta_n \) be a primitive \( n \)th root of unity. Show that \( [{\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}): {\mathbb{Q}}] = \phi(n)/2 \) for \( \phi \) the totient function.

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}

```
-   Some notation: let \( \alpha_k \coloneqq\zeta_n^k + \zeta_n^{-k} \).

-   Let \( m(x) \) be the minimal polynomial of \( \alpha_1 \coloneqq\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1} \). Note that \( \alpha_1 \in {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_n) \).

-   Use that \( { \mathsf{Gal}} ({\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_n)/{\mathbb{Q}}) \cong C_n^{\times} \), consisting of maps \( \sigma_k: \zeta \mapsto \zeta^k \) for \( \gcd(k, n) = 1 \), of which there are \( \phi(n) \) many.

-   Galois transitively permutes the roots of irreducible polynomials, so the roots of \( m \) are precisely the Galois conjugates of \( \alpha \), i.e.Â the Galois orbit of \( \alpha \), so we can just compute it. For illustrative purposes, suppose \( n \) is prime, then
    \[
    \sigma_1(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}) &= \zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}=\alpha_1 \\
    \sigma_2(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}) &= \zeta_n^2 + \zeta_n^{-2} = \alpha_2 \\
    \sigma_3(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}) &= \zeta_n^3 + \zeta_n^{-3} = \alpha_3 \\
    \vdots&\\
    \sigma_{n-1}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}) &= \zeta_n^{n-1} + \zeta_n^{-(n-1)} = \zeta_n^{-1} + \zeta_n^{1} = \alpha_1 \\
    \sigma_{n-2}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}) &= \zeta_n^{n-2} + \zeta_n^{-(n-2)} = \zeta_n^{-2} + \zeta_n^{2} = \alpha_2 \\
    \sigma_{n-3}(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1}) &= \zeta_n^{n-3} + \zeta_n^{-(n-3)} = \zeta_n^{-3} + \zeta_n^{3} = \alpha_3
    ,\]
    where we've used that \( \zeta^{k} = \zeta^{k\operatorname{mod}n} \). From this, we see that \( \sigma_{k}(\alpha_1)=\sigma_{n-k}(\alpha_1) \) and we pick up \( (n-1)/2 \) distinct conjugates.

-   For \( n \) not prime, the exact same argument runs through \( \phi(n) \) values of \( k \) for \( \sigma_k \), and again yields \( \sigma_{k}(\alpha_1) = \sigma_{\phi(n) - k}(\alpha_1) \). Matching them up appropriately yields \( \phi(n)/2 \) distinct roots.

Part 1:

-   \( L/K \) is cyclic means \( L/K \) is Galois and \( G\coloneqq{ \mathsf{Gal}} (L/K) = C_n \) for some \( n \).
-   By the FTGT, setting \( H \coloneqq{ \mathsf{Gal}} (L/E) \), we get \( H {~\trianglelefteq~}G \) precisely because \( E/K \) is normal, and \( { \mathsf{Gal}} (L/E) = G/H \).
-   But then if \( G \) is cyclic, \( H \leq G \) must be cyclic, and \( G/H \) is cyclic as well since writing \( G = C_n = \left\langle{x}\right\rangle \), we have \( G/H = \left\langle{xH}\right\rangle \).

Part 2:

-   Letting \( G\coloneqq{ \mathsf{Gal}} (L/K) = C_n \), by elementary group theory we have subgroups \( H\coloneqq C_d \leq C_n \) for every \( d \) dividing \( n \).
    -   A observation we'll need: every subgroup is normal here since \( G \) is abelian.
-   By the fundamental theorem, taking the fixed field of \( H \leq { \mathsf{Gal}} (L/K) \), we obtain some intermediate extension \( E\coloneqq K^H \) fitting into a tower \( L/E/K \).
-   By the fundamental theorem, \( [E: K] = [G:H] = n/d \), where we've used that \( H{~\trianglelefteq~}G \).
-   Letting \( d \) range through divisors lets \( n/d \) range through divisors, so we get extensions of every degree \( d \) dividing \( n \).

Let \( L/K \) be a finite extension of fields.

a.  Define what it means for \( L/K \) to be *separable*.

b.  Show that if \( K \) is a finite field, then \( L/K \) is always separable.

c.  Give an example of a finite extension \( L/K \) that is not separable.

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   \( L/k \) is **separable** iff every element \( \alpha \) is separable, i.e.Â the minimal polynomial \( m(x) \) of \( \alpha \) is a separable polynomial, i.e.Â \( m(x) \) has no repeated roots in (say) the algebraic closure of \( L \) (or just any splitting field of \( m \)).

-   If \( \operatorname{ch}k = p \), suppose toward a contradiction that \( L/k \) is not separable. Then there is some \( \alpha \) with an inseparable (and irreducible) minimal polynomial \( f(x)\in k[x] \).

-   Claim: since \( f \) is inseparable and irreducible, \( f(x) = g(x^p) \) for some \( g\in k[x] \).

    -   Note: write \( g(x) \coloneqq\sum a_k x^k \), so that \( f(x) = \sum a_k (x^p)^k = \sum a_k x^{pk} \).

-   This is a contradiction, since it makes \( f \) reducible by using the "Freshman's dream":
    \[
    f(x) = \sum a_k x^{pk} = \qty{ \sum a_k^{1\over p} x^k}^p \coloneqq(h(x))^p 
    .\]

-   Proof of claim: in \( \operatorname{ch}k = p, f \) inseparable \( \implies f(x) = g(x^p) \).

    -   Use that \( f \) is inseparable iff \( \gcd(f, f') \neq 1 \), and since \( f \) is irreducible this forces \( f' \equiv 0 \), so \( ka_k = 0 \) for all \( k \).
    -   Then \( a_k\neq 0 \) forces \( p\divides k \), so \( f(x) = a_0 + a_px^p + a_{2p}x^{2p} + \cdots \) and one takes \( g(x) \coloneqq\sum a_{kp}x^{kp} \).

-   A finite inseparable extension:

    -   It's a theorem that finite extensions of perfect fields are separable, so one needs a non-perfect field.
    -   Take \( L/k \coloneqq{\mathbb{F}}_p(t^{1\over p}) / {\mathbb{F}}_p(t) \), which is a degree \( p \) extension (although both fields are infinite are characteristic \( p \)).
    -   Then the minimal polynomial of \( t \) is \( f(x) \coloneqq x^p - t \in {\mathbb{F}}_p(t)[x] \), where \( f'(x) = px^p \equiv 0 \) Alternatively, just note that \( f \) factors as \( f(x) = (x-t^{1\over p})^p \) in \( L[x] \), which has multiple roots.

### Fall 2020 \#3 \

a.  Define what it means for a finite extension of fields \( E \) over \( F \) to be a *Galois* extension.

b.  Determine the Galois group of \( f(x) = x^3 - 7 \) over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \), and justify your answer carefully.

c.  Find all subfields of the splitting field of \( f(x) \) over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \).

::: {.solution}
Part a:

-   A finite extension \( E/F \) is **Galois** if it is normal and separable:
    -   Normal: every \( f\in F[x] \) either has no roots in \( E \) or all roots in \( E \).
    -   Separable: every element \( e\in E \) has a separable minimal polynomial \( m(x) \), i.e.Â \( m \) has no repeated roots.

Part b:

-   Note \( f \) is irreducible by Eisenstein with \( p=7 \), and since \( {\mathbb{Q}} \) is perfect, irreducible implies separable.

-   Writing \( L \coloneqq\operatorname{SF}(f)/{\mathbb{Q}} \), this is a Galois extension:

    -   \( L \) is separable: it is a finite extension of a perfect field, which is automatically separable.
    -   \( L \) is normal: \( L \) is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, and thus normal.

-   Since \( f \) is degree 3, we have \( G\coloneqq{ \mathsf{Gal}} (L/k) \leq S_3 \), and since \( G \) is a transitive subgroup the only possibilities are
    \[
    G = S_3 \cong D_3, A_3 \cong C_3
    .\]

-   Factor \( x^3 - 7 = (x-\omega)(x-\zeta_3\omega)(x-\zeta_3^2\omega) \) where \( \omega \coloneqq 7^{1\over 3} \) and \( \zeta_3 \) is a primitive 3rd root of unity. Then \( L = {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_3, \omega) \).

    -   Aside: label the roots in this order, so \( r_1 = \omega, r_2 = \zeta_3\omega, r_3 = \zeta_3^2\omega \).

-   Write \( \min_{\omega, {\mathbb{Q}}}(x) = x^3 - 7 \) and let \( L_0/{\mathbb{Q}}\coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(\omega)/{\mathbb{Q}} \) yields \( [L_0: {\mathbb{Q}}] = 3 \).

-   Write \( \min_{\zeta_3, {\mathbb{Q}}}(x) = (x^3-1)/(x-1) = x^2 + x + 1 \), and note that this is still the minimal polynomial over \( L_0 \) since \( L_0 \subseteq {\mathbb{R}} \) and \( \zeta_3 \in {\mathbb{C}}\setminus{\mathbb{R}} \). So \( [L:L_0] = 2 \).

-   Counting in towers,
    \[
    [L:{\mathbb{Q}}] = [L:L_0][L_0: {\mathbb{Q}}] = (2)(3) = 6
    .\]

-   But \( {\sharp}S_3 = 6 \) and \( {\sharp}A_3 = 3 \), so \( G = S_3 \).

-   Explicitly, since we can write \( \operatorname{SF}(f) = {\mathbb{Q}}(\omega, \zeta_3) \), we can find explicit generators:
    \[
    \sigma:
    &\begin{cases}
    \omega &\mapsto \omega
    \\
    \zeta_3 &\mapsto \zeta_3\cdot \zeta_3.
    \end{cases}
    &&
    \implies \sigma \sim (1,2,3) \\
    \tau:
    &\begin{cases}
    \omega &\mapsto \omega
    \\
    \zeta_3 &\mapsto \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu\zeta_3\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu.
    \end{cases}
    &&
    \implies \tau \sim (2, 3)
    .\]
    So \( G = \left\langle{\sigma, \tau {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}\sigma^3, \tau^2}\right\rangle \).

Part c:

-   Note that the subgroup lattice for \( S_3 \) looks like the following:

![](figures/2021-08-14_18-00-51.png)

-   Note that we can identify
    -   \( \tau = (2,3) \) which fixes \( r_1 \)
    -   \( \sigma \tau = (1,2) \) which fixes \( r_3 \)
    -   \( \sigma^2\tau = (1, 3) \) which fixes \( r_2 \)
    -   \( \sigma = (1,2,3) \), for which we need to calculate the fixed field. Using that \( \sigma(\omega) =\zeta\omega \) and \( \sigma(\zeta)=\zeta \), supposing \( \sigma(\alpha) = \alpha \) we have
        \[
        \sigma(\alpha) &\coloneqq\sigma(a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + d\omega + e\zeta_3\omega + f\zeta_3^2\omega) \\
        &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + d\zeta_3\omega + e\zeta_3^2\omega + f\omega \\
        \implies \alpha &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + t_1(\omega + \zeta_3\omega + \zeta_3^2\omega) \\
        \implies \alpha &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 + t_1\omega (1 + \zeta_3+ \zeta_3^2) \\
        \implies \alpha &= a + b\zeta_3 + c\zeta_3^2 
        ,\]
        using the general fact that \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\zeta_n^k = 0 \). So the fixed field is \( {\mathbb{Q}}(1, \zeta, \zeta^2) = {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta) \).
-   We thus get the following lattice correspondence:

```{=tex}

-   Useful trick: given \( a + \sqrt{b} \), try to rewrite this as \( (\sqrt{c} + \sqrt{d})^2 \) for some \( c, d \) to get a better basis for \( \operatorname{SF}(f) \).
:::

-   First consider \( g(z) \coloneqq z^2 + 4z + 64 \). Applying the quadratic formula yields
    \[
    z = {-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 64} \over 2} = -2 \pm {1\over 2}\sqrt{ -15 \cdot 16 } = -2 \pm 2i \sqrt{15}
    .\]

-   Substituting \( z=x^2 \) yields the splitting field of \( f \) as \( L\coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(\pm \sqrt{ -2 \pm 2i\sqrt{15}}) \).

    -   Note that this factorization shows that \( f \) is irreducible over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \), since the two quadratic factors have irrational coefficients and none of the roots are real.
    -   Irreducible implies separable over a perfect field, so \( L/{\mathbb{Q}} \) is a separable extension.
    -   \( L \) is the splitting field of a separable polynomial and thus normal, making \( L \) Galois.

-   In this form, it's not clear what the degree \( [L:{\mathbb{Q}}] \) is, so we can find a better basis by rewriting the roots of \( g \):
    \[
    z = -2 \pm 2i\sqrt{15} = \qty{\sqrt{5}}^2 - \qty{\sqrt 3}^2 \pm 2i\sqrt{5}\sqrt{3} = (\sqrt 5 \pm i\sqrt{3})^2
    ,\]
    and so the roots of \( f \) are \( x = \pm \sqrt{5} \pm i\sqrt{3} \) and \( L = {\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 5, i\sqrt 3) \).

-   Counting in towers,
    \[
    [L:{\mathbb{Q}}] = [{\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 5, i \sqrt{3} ) : {\mathbb{Q}}\sqrt{5} ][{\mathbb{Q}}\sqrt{5} : {\mathbb{Q}}] = (2)(2) = 4
    ,\]
    where we've used that \( \min_{\sqrt 5, {\mathbb{Q}}}(x) = x^2-5 \) and \( \min_{i\sqrt 3, {\mathbb{Q}}}(x) = x^2 + 3 \), which remains the minimal polynomial over \( {\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 5) \subseteq {\mathbb{R}} \) since both roots are not real.

-   So \( G\coloneqq{ \mathsf{Gal}} (L/{\mathbb{Q}}) \leq S_4 \) is a transitive subgroup of size 4, making it either \( C_4 \) or \( C_2^2 \).

-   Label the roots:
    \[
    r_1 &= \sqrt 5 + i\sqrt 3 \\
    r_2 &= \sqrt{5} - i \sqrt{3} \\
    r_3 &= - \sqrt 5 + i\sqrt 3 = -r_2 \\
    r_4 &= -\sqrt{5} - i\sqrt{3} = -r_1
    .\]

-   We can start writing down automorphisms:
    \[
    \sigma_1:
    \begin{cases}
    \sqrt 5 &\mapsto -\sqrt 5  
    \\
    i\sqrt 3 &\mapsto i\sqrt 3 .
    \end{cases}
    && \sigma_1 \sim (1,3)(2,4)
    \\
    \sigma_2
    \begin{cases}
    \sqrt 5 &\mapsto \sqrt 5  
    \\
    i\sqrt 3 &\mapsto -i\sqrt 3 .
    \end{cases}
    && \sigma_2 \sim (1, 2)(3, 4)
    .\]
    Note that these define automorphisms because we've specified what happens to a basis and they send roots to other roots.

-   Checking that \( \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \operatorname{id} \), this produces two distinct order 2 elements, forcing \( G \cong C_2^2 \) since \( C_4 \) only has one order 2 element. Explicitly, we have
    \[
    C_2^2 \cong G = \left\langle{\tau_1, \tau_2}\right\rangle = \left\{{\operatorname{id}, \tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_1 \tau_2}\right\} = \left\{{\operatorname{id}, (1,3)(2,4), (1,2)(3,4),  (1,4)(2,3) }\right\}
    ,\]
    and the generic subgroup lattice looks like:

![](figures/2021-08-15_00-02-28.png)

-   Computing some fixed fields. Write \( i \sqrt{3} = x, \sqrt{5} = y \), then elements in the splitting field are of the form \( \alpha = 1 + ax + by + cxy \).

    -   For \( \sigma_1 \), we have \( x\mapsto -x \), so
        \[
        \sigma_1(\alpha) = 1 - ax + by - cxy
        = \alpha \implies a=-a=0, c=-c=0
        ,\]
        so this preserves \( 1+by \), making the fixed field \( {\mathbb{Q}}(1, y) = {\mathbb{Q}}(i \sqrt{3}) \).

    -   For \( \sigma_2 \), we have \( y\mapsto -y \), so
        \[
        \sigma_2(\alpha) = 1 +ax -by -cxy = \alpha \implies b=-b=0,c=-c=0
        ,\]
        preserving \( 1 + ax \) and making the fixed field \( {\mathbb{Q}}(1, x) = {\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 5) \).

    -   For \( \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \), we have \( x\mapsto -x \) and \( y\mapsto -y \), so
        \[
        \sigma_1\sigma_2(\alpha) = 1 -ax -by +cxy = \alpha \implies a=-a=-, b=-b=0
        ,\]
        preserving \( 1 + cxy \) and yielding \( {\mathbb{Q}}(xy) = {\mathbb{Q}}(i\sqrt 3 \sqrt 5) \).

::: {.proof title="of a"}
Note that \( g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 2 \) has roots \( \beta = 2 \pm \sqrt{2} \), and so \( f \) has roots
\[
\alpha_1 &= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_2 &= \sqrt{2 - \sqrt 2} \\
\alpha_3 &= -\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_4 &= -\alpha_2
.\]

and splitting field \( K = {\mathbb{Q}}(\left\{{\alpha_i}\right\}) \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of b"}
\( K \) is the splitting field of a separable polynomial and thus Galois over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \). Moreover, Since \( f \) is irreducible by Eisenstein with \( p=2 \), the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of \( S^4 \), so the possibilities are:

-   \( S_4 \)
-   \( A_4 \)
-   \( D_4 \)
-   \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2) \times{\mathbb{Z}}/(2) \)
-   \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \)

We can note that \( g \) splits over \( L \coloneqq{\mathbb{Q}}(\sqrt 2) \), an extension of degree 2.

We can now note that \( \min(\alpha, L) \) is given by \( p(x) = x^2 - (2 + \sqrt 2) \), and so \( [K: L] = 2 \).

We then have
\[
[K: {\mathbb{Q}}] = [K: L] [L : {\mathbb{Q}}] = (2)(2) = 4
.\]

This \( {\left\lvert {{ \mathsf{Gal}} (K/{\mathbb{Q}})} \right\rvert} = 4 \), which leaves only two possibilities:

-   \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(2) \times{\mathbb{Z}}/(2) \)
-   \( {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \)

We can next check orders of elements. Take
\[
\sigma &\in { \mathsf{Gal}} (K/{\mathbb{Q}}) \\
\alpha_1 &\mapsto \alpha_2
.\]

Computations show that

-   \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 = 2 \), so \( \alpha_1 \alpha_2 = \sqrt 2 \)
-   \( \alpha_1^2 = 2 + \sqrt 2 \implies \sqrt 2 = \alpha_1^2 - 2 \)

and thus
\[
\sigma^2(\alpha_1) 
&= \sigma(\alpha_2) \\
&= \sigma\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\alpha_1}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\sqrt 2)}{\sigma(\alpha_1)} \\
&= \frac{\sigma(\alpha_1^2 - 2)}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \frac{\alpha_2^2 - 2}{\alpha_2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -2\alpha_2^{-1}\\
&= \alpha_2 - \frac{2\alpha_1}{\sqrt 2} \\
&= \alpha_2 -\alpha_1 \sqrt 2 \\
&\neq \alpha_1
,\]

and so the order of \( \sigma \) is strictly greater than 2, and thus 4, and thus \( { \mathsf{Gal}} (K/{\mathbb{Q}}) = \left\{{\sigma^k {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}1\leq k \leq 4}\right\} \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/(4) \).

Let \( K = {\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta) \). Then \( K \) is the splitting field of \( f(x) = x^n - 1 \), which is irreducible over \( {\mathbb{Q}} \), so \( K/{\mathbb{Q}} \) is normal. We also have \( f'(x) = nx^{n-1} \) and \( \gcd(f, f') = 1 \) since they can not share any roots.

> Or equivalently, \( f \) splits into distinct linear factors \( f(x) = \prod_{k\leq n}(x-\zeta^k) \).

Since it is a Galois extension, \( {\left\lvert {{ \mathsf{Gal}} (K/{\mathbb{Q}})} \right\rvert} = [K: {\mathbb{Q}}] = \phi(n) \) for the totient function.

We can now define maps
\[
\tau_j: K &\to K \\
\zeta &\mapsto \zeta^j 
\]
and if we restrict to \( j \) such that \( \gcd(n, j) = 1 \), this yields \( \phi(n) \) maps. Noting that if \( \zeta \) is a primitive root, then \( (n, j) = 1 \) implies that that \( \zeta^j \) is also a primitive root, and hence another root of \( \min(\zeta, {\mathbb{Q}}) \), and so these are in fact automorphisms of \( K \) that fix \( {\mathbb{Q}} \) and thus elements of \( { \mathsf{Gal}} (K/{\mathbb{Q}}) \).

So define a map
\[
\theta: {\mathbb{Z}}_n^{\times}&\to K \\

The claim is that this is a surjective homomorphism, and since both groups are the same size, an isomorphism.

Letting \( \sigma \in K \) be arbitrary, noting that \( [K: {\mathbb{Q}}] \) has a basis \( \left\{{1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \cdots, \zeta^{n-1}}\right\} \), it suffices to specify \( \sigma(\zeta) \) to fully determine the automorphism. (Since \( \sigma(\zeta^k) = \sigma(\zeta)^k \).)

In particular, \( \sigma(\zeta) \) satisfies the polynomial \( x^n - 1 \), since \( \sigma(\zeta)^n = \sigma(\zeta^n) = \sigma(1) = 1 \), which means \( \sigma(\zeta) \) is another root of unity and \( \sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^k \) for some \( 1\leq k \leq n \).

Moreover, since \( o(\zeta) = n \in K^{\times} \), we must have \( o(\zeta^k) = n \in K^{\times} \) as well. Noting that \( \left\{{\zeta^i}\right\} \) forms a cyclic subgroup \( H\leq K^{\times} \), then \( o(\zeta^k) = n \iff (n, k) = 1 \) (by general theory of cyclic groups).

Thus \( \theta \) is surjective.

-   \( L/K \) is separable, since \( F[x] \subseteq K[x] \), and so if \( \alpha \in L \) where \( f(x) \coloneqq\min(\alpha, F) \) has no repeated factors, then \( f'(x) \coloneqq\min(\alpha, K) \) divides \( f \) and thus can not have repeated factors.

By the Galois correspondence, it suffices to show that the fixed field of \( H_1 \cap H_2 \) is \( E_1 E_2 \).

Let \( \sigma \in H_1 \cap H_2 \); then \( \sigma \in \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}(K) \) fixes both \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \).

> Not sure if this works -- compositum is not literally product..?

Writing \( x \in E_1E_2 \) as \( x=e_1 e_2 \), we have
\[
\sigma(x) = \sigma(e_1 e_2) = \sigma(e_1) \sigma(e_2) = e_1 e_2  =x,
\]

so \( \sigma \) fixes \( E_1 E_2 \).

::: {.proof title="of b"}
That \( H_1 H_2 \subseteq G \) is clear, since if \( \sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2 \in H_1 H_2 \), then each \( \tau_i \) is an automorphism of \( K \) that fixes \( E_i \supseteq {\mathbb{Q}} \), so each \( \tau_i \) fixes \( {\mathbb{Q}} \) and thus \( \sigma \) fixes \( {\mathbb{Q}} \).

-   Let \( \sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \in H_1 H_2 \).

-   Note that \( \sigma_1(e) = e \) for all \( e\in E_1 \) by definition, since \( H_1 \) fixes \( E_1 \), and \( \sigma_2(e) \in E_1 \) (?).

-   Then
    \[
    \sigma_1(e) = e \quad \forall e \in E_1 \implies \sigma_1(\sigma_2(e)) = \sigma_2(e) 
    \]
    and substituting \( e = \sigma_1(e) \) on the RHS yields
    \[
    \sigma_1 \sigma_2(e) = \sigma_2 \sigma_1(e)
    ,\]
    where a similar proof holds for \( e\in E_2 \) and thus for arbitrary \( x\in E_1 E_2 \).
:::
:::

::: {.proof title="of c"}
By the Galois correspondence, the subgroup \( H_1H_2 \leq G \) will correspond to an intermediate field \( E \) such that \( K/E/{\mathbb{Q}} \) and \( E \) is the fixed field of \( H_1 H_2 \).

But if \( \sigma \in H_1 H_2 \), then \( \sigma = \tau_1 \tau_2 \) where \( \tau_i \) is an automorphism of \( K \) that fixes \( E_i \), and so
\[
\sigma(x) = x \iff \tau_1\tau_2(x) = x

\tau_1(x) = x &\iff x \in E_1 \cap E_2

-   In \( \operatorname{SF}(f) \), since \( \operatorname{ch}F = p \) we have \( f(x) = (x-\zeta)^p \) for some \( \zeta = a^{1\over p} \).
    -   So if \( f \) is reducible in \( F[x] \), we have \( f(x) = p_1(x) p_2(x) \) where \( p(x) = (x-\zeta)^q\in F[x] \) for some \( 1\leq q < p \), since these are the only factors of \( f \).

-   We have \( x^q-\zeta^q \in F[x] \), so \( \zeta^q\in F \).

-   WLOG, \( g(x) = \prod_{i=1}^\ell (x-r_i) \) for some \( 1\leq \ell \leq p-1 \), i.e.Â rearrange the factors so that \( g \) is the first \( \ell \) of them.

    -   \( \ell \neq 1, p \) since \( f \) is reducible, making \( g, h \) nonconstant.

-   Each \( r_i \) is a root of \( f \), so \( r_i^p - a = 0 \) for all \( i \), so \( r_i^p = a \).

    so \( R_\ell^p = a^\ell \).

-   Use Bezout: \( \gcd(\ell, p) = 1 \) since \( p \) is prime, so write \( tp + s\ell = 1 \) for some \( t,s\in {\mathbb{Z}} \)

-   Use this to build a root of \( f \) that's in \( {\mathbb{F}} \): write
    \[
    a &= a^1\\
    &= a^{tp + s\ell} \\
    &= a^{tp} a^{s\ell} \\

    so \( a = \beta^p \).

    -   Check \( \beta\in {\mathbb{F}} \): use that \( R_\ell \in {\mathbb{F}} \) since it was a constant term of a polynomial in \( {\mathbb{F}}[x] \), \( a\in {\mathbb{F}} \) by assumption, and fields are closed under taking powers and products.

It suffices to show that

We have

Since \( R \) is an integral domain, \( s_1 s_2 \neq 0 \). Then

-   There is a nonempty set \( X \) an monomorphism \( X\hookrightarrow M \) of sets such that for every \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module \( N \), every set map \( X\to N \) lifts to a unique \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module morphism \( M\to N \), so the following diagram commutes:

-   Since \( F \) is free, there is a generating set \( X = \left\{{x_\alpha}\right\} \) and a map \( \iota:X\hookrightarrow F \) satisfying the 3rd property from (a).

    -   If we construct any map \( f: X\to M \), the universal property modules will give a lift \( \tilde f: F\to M \)

-   Identify \( X \) with \( \iota(X) \subseteq F \).

-   For every \( x\in X \), the preimage \( \pi^{-1}(x) \) is nonempty by surjectivity. So arbitrarily pick any preimage.

-   \( \left\{{\iota(x_\alpha)}\right\} \subseteq F \) and \( \pi \) is surjective, so choose fibers \( \left\{{y_\alpha}\right\} \subseteq M \) such that \( \pi(y_\alpha) = \iota(x_\alpha) \) and define
    \[
    f: X&\to M \\

    -   Write \( f= \sum r_i x_i \), then since both maps are \( R{\hbox{-}} \)module morphism, by \( R{\hbox{-}} \)linearity we can write
        \[

By the correspondence theorem, submodules of \( M/N \) biject with submodules \( A \) of \( M \) containing \( N \).

So

-   \( \iff \) no such (proper, nontrivial) submodule \( A \) exists

-   \( \iff \) there are no (proper, nontrivial) submodules of \( M/N \)

Identify \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)modules with abelian groups, then by (a), \( N \) is maximal \( \iff \) \( M/N \) is simple \( \iff \) \( M/N \) has no nontrivial proper subgroups.\

By Cauchy's theorem, if \( {\left\lvert {M/N} \right\rvert} = ab \) is a composite number, then \( a\divides ab \implies \) there is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order \( a \). In this case, \( M/N \) contains a nontrivial proper cyclic subgroup, so \( M/N \) is not simple. So \( {\left\lvert {M/N} \right\rvert} \) can not be composite, and therefore must be prime.

-   Since \( H\neq G \), there is some \( p \) and some \( k \) such that \( \zeta_{p^k}\not\in H \).

    -   Otherwise, if \( H \) contains every \( \zeta_{p^k} \) it contains every \( \zeta_n \)

Then there must be a prime \( p \) such that the \( \zeta_{p^k} \not \in H \) for all \( k \) greater than some constant \( m \) -- otherwise, we can use the fact that if \( \zeta_{p^k} \in H \) then \( \zeta_{p^\ell} \in H \) for all \( \ell \leq k \), and if \( \zeta_{p^k} \in H \) for all \( p \) and all \( k \) then \( H = G \).

But this means there are infinitely many elements in \( G\setminus H \), and so \( \infty = [G: H] = {\left\lvert {G/H} \right\rvert} \) is not a prime. Thus by (b), \( H \) can not be maximal, a contradiction.

::: {.claim}
If \( A \in \operatorname{GL}(m, {\mathbb{F}}) \) is invertible and \( A^n/{\mathbb{F}} \) is diagonalizable, then \( A/{\mathbb{F}} \) is diagonalizable.
:::

::: {.proof title="of claim"}
-   Let \( A \in \operatorname{GL}(m, {\mathbb{F}}) \).

-   Since \( A^n \) is diagonalizable, \( \min_{A^n}(x) \in {\mathbb{F}}[x] \) is separable and thus factors as a product of \( m \) **distinct** linear factors:
    \[
    \min_{A^n}(x) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x-\lambda_i), \quad \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0
    \]

    where \( \left\{{\lambda_i}\right\}_{i=1}^m \subset {\mathbb{F}} \) are the **distinct** eigenvalues of \( A^n \).

-   Moreover \( A\in \operatorname{GL}(m,{\mathbb{F}}) \implies A^n \in \operatorname{GL}(m,{\mathbb{F}}) \): \( A \) is invertible \( \iff \operatorname{det}(A) = d \in {\mathbb{F}}^{\times} \), and so \( \operatorname{det}(A^n) = \operatorname{det}(A)^n = d^n \in {\mathbb{F}}^{\times} \) using the fact that the determinant is a ring morphism \( \operatorname{det}: \operatorname{Mat}(m\times m) \to{\mathbb{F}} \) and \( {\mathbb{F}}^{\times} \) is closed under multiplication.

-   So \( A^n \) is invertible, and thus has trivial kernel, and thus zero is not an eigenvalue, so \( \lambda_i \neq 0 \) for any \( i \).

-   Since the \( \lambda_i \) are distinct and nonzero, this implies \( x^k \) is not a factor of \( \mu_{A^n}(x) \) for any \( k\geq 0 \). Thus the \( m \) terms in the product correspond to precisely \( m \) **distinct linear** factors.

-   We can now construct a polynomial that annihilates \( A \), namely
    \[
    q_A(x) \coloneqq\min_{A^n}(x^n) = \prod_{i=1}^m (x^n-\lambda_i) \in {\mathbb{F}}[x],
    \]

    where we can note that \( q_A(A) = \min_{A^n}(A^n) = 0 \), and so \( \min_A(x) \divides q_A(x) \) by minimality.

::: {.claim}
\( q_A(x) \) has exactly \( nm \) distinct linear factors in \( { \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu \mathbb{F}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu }[x] \)
:::

-   This reduces to showing that no pair \( x^n-\lambda_i, x^n-\lambda_j \) share a root. and that \( x^n-\lambda_i \) does not have multiple roots.

-   For the first claim, we can factor
    \[
    x^n - \lambda_i = \prod_{k=1}^n (x - \lambda_i^{1\over n} e^{2\pi i k \over n}) \coloneqq\prod_{k=1}^n (x-\lambda^{1\over n} \zeta_n^k)
    ,\]
    where we now use the fact that \( i\neq j \implies \lambda_i^{1\over n} \neq \lambda_j^{1\over n} \). Thus no term in the above product appears as a factor in \( x^n - \lambda_j \) for \( j\neq i \).

-   For the second claim, we can check that \( {\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\,}\qty{x^n - \lambda_i} = nx^{n-1}\neq 0\in {\mathbb{F}} \), and \( \gcd(x^n-\lambda_i, nx^{n-1}) = 1 \) since the latter term has only the roots \( x=0 \) with multiplicity \( n-1 \), whereas \( \lambda_i\neq 0 \implies \) zero is not a root of \( x^n-\lambda_i \).

But now since \( q_A(x) \) has exactly distinct linear factors in \( \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\mathbb{F}}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu[x] \) and \( \min_A(x) \divides q_A(x) \), \( \min_A(x) \in {\mathbb{F}}[x] \) can only have distinct linear factors, and \( A \) is thus diagonalizable over \( {\mathbb{F}} \).

Then
\[
V \cong \frac{k[x]}{m(x)} \cong \frac{k[x]}{(x^m)} \oplus \frac{k[x]}{(\rho)}
\coloneqq U \oplus W
\]
by the Chinese Remainder theorem.

We can now note that \(  {\left.{{\phi}} \right|_{{U}} }  \) is nilpotent because it has characteristic polynomial \( x^m \), and \(  {\left.{{\phi}} \right|_{{W}} }  \) is nonsingular since \( \lambda = 0 \) is not an eigenvalue by construction.

Letting \( \mathbf{v} \) be fixed, since \( \left\{{A^j \mathbf{v}}\right\} \) spans \( V \) we have A
\[
B\mathbf{v} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_j A^j \mathbf{v}
.\]

So let \( p(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_jx^j \). Then consider how \( B \) acts on any basis vector \( A^k \mathbf{v} \).

We have
\[
BA^k \mathbf{v} 
&= A^k B\mathbf{v} \\
&= A^k p(A) \mathbf{v} \\
&= p(A) A^k \mathbf{v}

so \( B = p(A) \) as operators since their actions agree on every basis vector in \( V \).

-   If \( \left\{{A^j \mathbf{v}_k {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}0\leq j \leq n-1}\right\} \) is linearly independent, this means that \( A \) does satisfy any polynomial of degree \( d < n \).

-   So \( \deg m_A(x) = n \), and since \( m_A(x) \) divides \( \chi_A(x) \) and both are monic degree polynomials of degree \( n \), they must be equal.

-   Let \( A\curvearrowright k[x] \) by \( A \curvearrowright p(x) \coloneqq p(A) \). This induces an invariant factor decomposition \( V =\cong \bigoplus k[x]/(f_i) \).

-   Since the product of the invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial, the largest invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and these two are equal, there can only be one invariant factor and thus the invariant factor decomposition is
    \[
    V\cong \frac{k[x]}{(\chi_A(x))}
    \]
    as an isomorphism of \( k[x]{\hbox{-}} \)modules.

-   So \( V \) is a cyclic \( k[x] \) module, which means that \( V = k[x]\curvearrowright\mathbf{v} \) for some \( \mathbf{v}\in V \) such that \( \operatorname{Ann}(\mathbf{v}) = \chi_A(x) \), i.e.Â there is some element \( \mathbf{v}\in V \) whose orbit is all of \( V \).

-   But then noting that monomials span \( k[x] \) as a \( k{\hbox{-}} \)module, we can write
    \[
    V &\cong
    k[x] \curvearrowright\mathbf{v} \\

    where we've used that \( x \) acts by \( A \) and thus \( x^k \) acts by \( A^k \).

-   Moreover, we can note that if \( \ell \geq \deg \chi_A(x) \), then \( A^\ell \) is a linear combination of \( \left\{{A^j \mathrel{\Big|}0 \leq j \leq n-1}\right\} \), and so
    \[

    \begin{bmatrix}
    B & C \\

    -   The first case is true because \( \deg f' < \deg f \), and if \( \gcd(f, f') = p \), then \( \deg p < \deg f \) and \( p\divides f \) forces \( p=1 \) since \( f \) is irreducible.

-   We'll use rank-nullity throughout: \( \operatorname{rank}M + \dim \ker M = 7 \).

-   Also note that
    \[
    Av = \lambda v
    \implies
    A^nv = A^{n-1}Av = A^{n-1}\lambda v = \cdots = \lambda^n v
    ,\]
    so if \( \lambda \in \operatorname{Spec}(A) \) then \( \lambda^n\in \operatorname{Spec}(A^n) \). Conversely, \( \lambda\in \operatorname{Spec}(A^n) \implies \lambda^{1\over n}\in \operatorname{Spec}(A) \), which we'll use several times.

-   Since \( 5 = \operatorname{rank}A = \operatorname{rank}(A - 0\cdot I) \), we have \( \dim \ker(A-0\cdot I) = 2 \) contributing an eigenvalue of \( \lambda = 0 \) with multiplicity \( 2 \).

-   Since \( 4 = \operatorname{rank}A^2 = \operatorname{rank}(A^2 - 0\cdot \lambda) = \operatorname{rank}(A-0\cdot \lambda)^2 \), we have that \( \dim \ker(A-0\cdot I)^2 = 3 \). Since \( \dim \ker (A-0\cdot I)^1 = 2 < 3 \), this means there is 1 generalized eigenvector associated to \( \lambda = 0 \).

-   Since \( 6 = \operatorname{rank}(A-1\cdot I) \), \( \dim \ker (A- 1\cdot I) = 1 \), contributing \( \lambda = 1 \) with multiplicity 1.

-   Since \( \operatorname{rank}(A^3-1\cdot I) = 4 \), we have \( \dim \ker (A^3-1\cdot I) = 3 \), contributing \( \lambda = 1 \) *now to \( \operatorname{Spec}(A^3) \)* instead of \( \operatorname{Spec}(A) \). Thus some unknown cube roots of 1 are contributed to \( \operatorname{Spec}(A) \), so any of \( 1=\zeta_3^0, \zeta_3, \zeta_3^2 \) are possibilities at this point. Call these three contributions \( z_1, z_2, z_3 \), which may not be distinct.

-   Now use that \( {\mathrm{tr}}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \) is the sum of the diagonal on \( \operatorname{JCF}(A) \), using that trace is a similarity invariant, to write
    \[
    1 = {\mathrm{tr}}(A) = (0 + 0) + (0) + (1) + (z_1 + z_2 + z_3) \implies z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 0 
    ,\]
    which is actually enough to force \( z_1 = 1, z_2 = \zeta_3, z_3 = \zeta_3^2 \), since no other combination sums to zero. That \( 1 + \zeta_3 + \zeta_3^2 = 0 \) is a general fact.

-   Since \( \lambda=1 \) occurs twice as an eigenvalue but \( \dim \ker(A-1\cdot I) = 1 \), the two copies of \( \lambda = 1 \) must occur in a nontrivial Jordan block.

-   So we get a Jordan form
    \[
    \operatorname{JCF}(A) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & & & & & &

::: {.solution}
**Proof of (a)**: Let \( A \) be the matrix in the question, and \( B \) be the matrix containing 1's in every entry.

-   Noting that \( B = A+I \), we have
    \[
    &B\mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x} \\
    &\iff (A+I) \mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x} \\
    &\iff A \mathbf{x} = (\lambda - 1) \mathbf{x}
    ,\]
    so we will find the eigenvalues of \( B \) and subtract one from each.

-   Note that \( B\mathbf{v} = {\left[ {\sum v_i, \sum v_i, \cdots, \sum v_i} \right]} \), i.e.Â it has the effect of summing all of the entries of \( \mathbf{v} \) and placing that sum in each component.

-   We proceed by finding \( p \) eigenvectors and eigenvalues, since the JCF and minimal polynomials will involve eigenvalues and the transformation matrix will involve (generalized) eigenvectors.

::: {.claim title="1"}
Each vector of the form \( \mathbf{p}_i \coloneqq\mathbf{e}_1 - \mathbf{e}_{i+1} = {\left[ {1, 0, 0,\cdots, 0 -1, 0, \cdots, 0 } \right]} \) where \( i\neq j \) is also an eigenvector with eigenvalues \( \lambda_0 = 0 \), and this gives \( p-1 \) linearly independent vectors spanning the eigenspace \( E_{\lambda_0} \)
:::

::: {.claim title="2"}
\( \mathbf{v}_1 = {\left[ {1, 1, \cdots, 1} \right]} \) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 = p \).
:::

-   Using that the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( 1+\lambda_i \) for \( \lambda_i \) the above eigenvalues for \( B \),
    \[
    \operatorname{Spec}(B) \coloneqq\left\{{(\lambda_i, m_i)}\right\} &=  \left\{{(p, 1), (0, p-1)}\right\}  \implies \chi_{B}(x) = (x-p)x^{p-1} \\ 
    \implies \operatorname{Spec}(A) &= \left\{{(p-1,1), (-1, p-1) }\right\}  \implies \chi_{A}(x) = (x- p+1)(x+1)^{p-1} \\
    \]

-   The dimensions of eigenspaces are preserved, thus
    \[
    JCF_{\mathbb{Q}}(A)
    =  J_{p-1}^{1} \oplus (p-1)J_{-1}^1
    =
    \left[\begin{array}{r|r|r|r|r|r}
    p-1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
    \hline
    0& -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
    0& 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
    0& 0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ \hline

    0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    .\]

-   The matrix \( P \) such that \( A = PJP^{-1} \) will have columns the bases of the generalized eigenspaces.

-   In this case, the generalized eigenspaces are the usual eigenspaces, so
    \[
    P = [\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{p}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{p}_{p-1}] =
    \left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\
    1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    .\]

::: {.proof title="of claim 1"}
```{=tex}

```
-   Compute
    \[B \mathbf{p}_i = {\left[ { 1 + 0 + \cdots + 0 + (-1) + 0 + \cdots + 0} \right]} = {\left[ {0, 0, \cdots, 0} \right]}\]
-   So every \( \mathbf{p}_i \in \ker(B) \), so they are eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0.
-   Since the first component is fixed and we have \( p-1 \) choices for where to place a \( -1 \), this yields \( p-1 \) possibilities for \( \mathbf{p}_i \)
-   These are linearly independent since the \( (p-1)\times (p-1) \) matrix \( {\left[ { \mathbf{p}_1^t, \cdots, \mathbf{p}_{p-1}^t} \right]} \) satisfies
    \[
    \operatorname{det}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
    -1 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & -1  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 0 & -1 & \cdots & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & -1\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    &= (1) \cdot \operatorname{det}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & -1  & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 0 & -1 & \cdots & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0  & 0 & \cdots & -1\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \\
    &= (-1)^{p-2} \neq 0
    .\]

where the first equality follows from expanding along the first row and noting this is the first minor, and every other minor contains a row of zeros.
:::

::: {.proof title="of claim 2"}

-   Compute
    \[B\mathbf{v} = {\left[ {\sum_{i=1}^p 1, \sum_{i=1}^p 1, \cdots, \sum_{i=1}^p 1} \right]} = {\left[ {p, p, \cdots, p} \right]} = p {\left[ {1, 1, \cdots, 1} \right]} = p\mathbf{v}_1,\]
    thus \( \lambda_1 = p \)
-   \( \dim E_{\lambda_1} = 1 \) since the eigenspaces are orthogonal and \( E_{\lambda_0} \oplus E_{\lambda_1} \leq F^p \) is a subspace, so \( p > \dim(E_{\lambda_0}) + \dim E_{\lambda_1} = p-1 + \dim E_{\lambda_1} \) and it isn't zero dimensional.
:::

**Proof of (b)**:

For \( F = {\mathbb{F}}_p \), all eigenvalues/vectors still lie in \( {\mathbb{F}}_p \), but now \( -1 = p-1 \), making \( (x-(p-1))(x+1)^{p-1} = (x+1)(x+1)^{p-1} \), so \( \chi_{A, {\mathbb{F}}_p}(x) = (x+1)^p \), and the Jordan blocks may merge.

-   A computation shows that \( (A+I)^2 = pA = 0 \in M_p({\mathbb{F}}_p) \) and \( (A+I) \neq 0 \), so \( \min_{A, {\mathbb{F}}_p}(x) = (x+1)^2 \).
    -   Thus the largest Jordan block corresponding to \( \lambda = -1 \) is of size 2
-   Can check that \( \operatorname{det}(A) = \pm 1 \in {\mathbb{F}}_p^{\times} \), so the vectors \( \mathbf{e}_1 - \mathbf{e}_i \) are still linearly independent and thus \( \dim E_{-1} = p-1 \)
    -   So there are \( p-1 \) Jordan blocks for \( \lambda = 0 \).

Summary:
\[
\min_{A, {\mathbb{F}}_p}(x) &= (x+1)^2 \\
\chi_{A, {\mathbb{F}}_p}(x) &\equiv (x+1)^p \\
\dim E_{-1} &= p-1
.\]

Thus
\[
JCF_{{\mathbb{F}}_p}(A)
=  J_{-1}^{2} \oplus (p-2)J_{-1}^1
= \left[\begin{array}{rr|r|r|r|r}
-1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0& -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0& 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 0 \\ \hline
0& 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\]

To obtain a basis for \( E_{\lambda = 0} \), first note that the matrix \( P = [\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{p}_1, \cdots , \mathbf{p}_{p-1}] \) from part (a) is singular over \( {\mathbb{F}}_p \), since
\[
\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{p}_{p-2}
&= [p-1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= [-1, 0,0,\cdots, 0, 1] \\
&= - \mathbf{p}_{p-1}
.\]

We still have a linearly independent set given by the first \( p-1 \) columns of \( P \), so we can extend this to a basis by finding one linearly independent generalized eigenvector.

Solving \( (A-I\lambda)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}_1 \) is our only option (the others won't yield solutions). This amounts to solving \( B\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}_1 \), which imposes the condition \( \sum x_i = 1 \), so we can choose \( \mathbf{x} = [1, 0, \cdots, 0] \).

Thus
\[
P = [\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{p}_{p-2}] =
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right]

\hfill
```
-   Let \( a\in R \) and define \( \phi(x) = ax \).
-   If \( \phi \) is injective, then it is surjective, so \( 1 = ax \) for some \( x \implies x^{-1}= a \).

The nilradical is contained in the Jacobson radical, i.e.
\[
{\sqrt{0_{R}} } \subseteq J(R)
.\]
:::

::: {.solution}
Maximal \( \implies \) prime, and so if \( x \) is in every prime ideal, it is necessarily in every maximal ideal as well.
:::

::: {.problem title="Mod by nilradical to kill nilpotents"}
\( R/ {\sqrt{0_{R}} } \) has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```

\[
a + {\sqrt{0_{R}} } \text{ nilpotent } &\implies (a+ {\sqrt{0_{R}} })^n \coloneqq a^n + {\sqrt{0_{R}} }= {\sqrt{0_{R}} } \\
&\implies a^n \in {\sqrt{0_{R}} } \\
&\implies \exists \ell \text{ such that } (a^n)^\ell = 0 \\
&\implies a\in {\sqrt{0_{R}} }
.

The nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals, i.e.
\[
{\sqrt{0_{R}} } = \displaystyle\bigcap_{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec}(R)} \mathfrak{p}
\]
:::

::: {.solution}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   \( {\sqrt{0_{R}} } \subseteq \cap\mathfrak{p} \):

-   \( x \in {\sqrt{0_{R}} } \implies x^n = 0 \in \mathfrak p \implies x\in \mathfrak{p} \text{ or } x^{n-1}\in\mathfrak p \).

-   \( R\setminus{\sqrt{0_{R}} } \subseteq \cup_{{\mathfrak{p}}} (R\setminus\mathfrak{p}) \):

-   Define \( S = \left\{{I{~\trianglelefteq~}R {~\mathrel{\Big\vert}~}a^n\not\in I \text{ for any } n}\right\} \).
