## Problem 1
The splitting field of this polynomial is $\QQ(\sqrt[3]2, \sqrt 3, \zeta_3)$ where $\zeta_3$ is a primitive third root of unity. 

To get the degree of this extension, we extend fields in the indicated order.
Since $\QQ(\sqrt[3] 2, \sqrt 3)$ is totally real, the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ over it still has degree $\phi(3) = 2$.
A quick check also shows that $\sqrt 3$ is not contained in $\QQ(\sqrt[3] 2)$, yielding another degree 2 extension, and finally a degree 3 extension.

Thus we have an extension of degree 12, and since we've constructed a Galois extension $L$ (a separable splitting field), if we define $G \definedas \Gal(\QQ/L)$, we have $\abs G = 12$.
Since we know that the splitting field of $\QQ(\sqrt[3] 2)/ \QQ$ has Galois group $D_3$, we must have $D_3 \leq G$.
This reduces the possibilities just $D_3 \cross \ZZ_2 \cong D_6$.

We have the following subgroup diagram (Figure 1).

![Subgroup Diagram](figures/2019-10-24-10:23.png)\

where we can simplify things by only considering conjugacy classes of subgroups, since these will correspond to conjugate field extensions (Figure 2).

![Subgroups up to Conjugacy](figures/2019-10-24-11:25.png)\

We can explicitly identify the relevant automorphisms:
\[
\begin{align*}
\sigma: \sqrt[3] 2 \mapsto \zeta_3 \sqrt[3] 2 \\
\tau: \zeta_3 \mapsto \zeta_3^2 \\
\gamma: \sqrt 3 \mapsto -\sqrt 3
.\end{align*}
\]
We can then present $G = \generators{\sigma, \gamma, \tau \mid \sigma^3 = \tau^2 = \gamma^2 = (\sigma\tau)^2 = [\sigma, \gamma] = [\tau, \gamma] = e}$, and obtain the following lattice:

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
                                            &  & {<\sigma, \tau, \gamma>}                       &                                                         &                                      &  &                                                 \\

\]

which, up to conjugacy, fix the following intermediate field extensions (Figure 3).

$\qed$ 

## Problem 2
We can note that since $f$ has 4 roots, the Galois group $G$ of its splitting field will be a subgroup of $S_4$.
Moreover, $G$ must be a *transitive subgroup* of $S_4$, i.e. the action of $G$ on the roots of $f$ should be transitive.
This reduces the possibilities to $G \cong S^4, A^4, D^4, \ZZ_4, \ZZ_2^2$.

Since $f$ has exactly 2 real roots and thus a pair of roots that are complex conjugates, the automorphism given by complex conjugation is an element of $G$.
But this corresponds to a 2-cycle $\tau = (ab)$, and we can then make the following conclusions:

- Not $A_4$: $A_4$ contains only even cycles, and $\tau$ is odd.
- Not $Z_4$: This subgroup is generated by a single 4-cycle $\sigma$, which up to conjugacy is $(1234)$, and $\sigma^n$ is not a 2-cycle for any $n$.
- Not $\ZZ_2^2$: In order to be transitive, this subgroup must be $\theset{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}$, which does not contain $\tau$.

The only remaining possibilities are $S^4$ and $D^4$. $\qed$

## Problem 3

### Part 1

To see that $\phi(n)$ is even for all $n>2$, we can take a prime factorization of $n$ and write
$$
\phi(n) = \phi\left( \prod_{i=1}^m p_i^{k_i}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^m \phi(p_i^{k_i}) = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{k_i - 1}(p - 1) = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{k_i - 1} \prod_{i=1}^m (p - 1)
$$

where each $k_i \geq 1 \implies k_i-1 \geq 0$. But every prime power is odd, and a product of odd numbers is odd, so the first product is odd.
It is also true that $p-1$ is even for every prime $p$, and the second term is a product of even terms and thus even.
So $\phi(n)$ is the product of an even and an odd number, which is always even.


### Part 2
Suppose $\phi(n) = 2$. Take a prime factorization of $n$, so we have
$$
2 = \phi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^m \phi(p_i^{k_i}) 
$$

Since the only factors of 2 are 1 and 2, we must have $\phi(p_i^{k_i}) = 2$ for exactly one $i$, and the rest must be equal to 1.

Consider the term that equals 2. We have $\phi(p_i^{k_i}) = p^{k_i - 1}(p-1) = 2$, so we must have either

- Case 1: $p-1 = 2$ and $p^{k_i - 1} = 1$, so $p=3$ and $k_i = 1$. So $3 \divides n$, but $3^\ell$ does *not* divide $n$ for any $\ell > 1$.
- Case 2: $p^{k_i - 1} = 2$ and $(p-1) = 1$, so $p=2$ and $k_i = 2$. Thus $2^2$ divides $n$ but $2^\ell$ does not for any $\ell > 2$.

In either case, it remains to check are whether the other factors where $\phi(p_j^{k_j}) = 1$ can contribute any other distinct divisors to $n$.
We can note that $\phi(p_j^{k_j}) = 1$ iff $p^{k_j-1}(p-1) = 1$, so this forces $p=2$ and $k_j = 1$. So $n$ may or may not contain a single factor of 2, but by uniqueness of prime factorization, this can only happen in case 1.
Note that this also forces $2\divides n$ but $2^2$ does not divide $n$.

In summary, we've found that $\phi(n) = 2$ implies that 

- $3 \divides n$, 9 does not divide $n$, and
  - $2\divides n$, 4 does not divide $n$
  - $2$ does not divide $n$
- $2^2 \divides n, 2^3$ does not divide n.

This reduces the possibilities to the finite set $n \in \theset{6,3,4}$, and $\phi(6) = \phi(3) = \phi(4) = 2$. $\qed$

## Problem 4

Note that since $\zeta(\zeta+\zeta\inv) = \zeta^2 + 1$, we have the relation $\zeta^2  - (\zeta+\zeta\inv)\zeta + 1 = 0$. But then
$$
f(x) = x^2 - (\zeta + \zeta\inv)x + 1
$$

is a polynomial in $\QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv)$ for which $f(\zeta) = 0$. 
Thus $g = \min(\zeta, \QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv))$ divides $f$, but since $\deg f = 2$ and $\QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv)$ is totally real, $\zeta\not\in\QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv)$.
This means that $g$ can not be linear and must have degree at least 2, but the above argument shows that $g$ has degree at *most* 2, so it must be 2.
Letting $m = [\QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv): \QQ]$, we have
\[
\begin{align*}
[\QQ(\zeta) : \QQ] &= [\QQ(\zeta): \QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv)] [\QQ(\zeta + \zeta\inv) : \QQ] \\
\implies \phi(n) &= 2 m
,\end{align*}
\]

and so $m = \phi(n)/2$ as desired.

## Problem 5

Suppose $F = K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n]$ where $\alpha_1^{n_1} \in K$ for some $n_1$ and }or each $i$ we have $\alpha_i^{n_i} \in K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}]$ for some powers $n_i$.
We want to show that $F = E[\beta_1, \cdots \beta_m]$ where each $\beta_i$ satisfy a similar condition.

Let $A = \theset{\alpha_i \suchthat \alpha_i \not\in E}$, then it is since $E \injects F$, adjoining all elements of $A$ to $E$ will yield exactly $F$.
Using the order of $\alpha_i$ given by the definition of $F$ as a radical extension, let $\beta_1$ be the $\alpha_i \in A$ with the smallest index $i$.
Then by assumption, there is some $m_1$ such that $\beta^{m_1} \in K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}] \subset F$, so we can construct $F_1 \definedas E[\beta_1]$ which will be a radical extension.

Inductively letting $A_2 = A \setminus\theset{\beta_1}$ and repeating this process to construct $L_2$ will yield radical extensions at every step, and since $A$ is finite,
there is some $n$ such that $L_n = L$. But then $L$ is a radical extension over $E$ as desired.


## Problem 6

### Part 1
Since $f$ is irreducible of degree $n$ and $u$ is a root of $f$, the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $K$ is in fact $f$, and thus the degree of the extension $K(u) / K$ is given by

$$
[K(u) : K] = \deg \min(u, K) = n.
$$

To see that $K(u)$ is not Galois, we just note that since $f$ was irreducible, and $u$ was only one root of $f$, $K(u)$ is not the splitting field of $f$, and is thus not the splitting field of any other irreducible polynomial over $K$.

To see that $\mathrm{Aut}(K(u)/ K)$ is trivial, note that any $K\dash$automorphism of $K(u)$ can only send $u$ to one of its conjugates. But the only conjugate of $u$ in $K(u)$ is $u$ itself, so only the identity automorphism can occur.

### Part 2

The normal closure $L$ of $K$ is defined as the smallest extension of $K$ such that if $\alpha$ is a root of any irreducible polynomial in $K[x]$ and $\alpha \in L$, then all of its conjugates are in $L$ as well.
But this means any such polynomial splits in $L$. 
In particular, if $u\in L$, then $f$ splits in $L$, and so $L$ contains the splitting field $F$.

### Part 3
By a theorem in class, this would force $\Gal(E/K)$ to be solvable, which would imply that $S_n$ is solvable -- but for $n\geq 5, S_n$ will not be solvable, a contradiction.

# Qual Problems

## Problem 1

### Part 1
If $L/K$ is a finite field extension which is both separable and a splitting field of some polynomial in $K[x]$, then $[L: K] = \abs{\Gal}{L/ K}$.

### Part 2

The extension $\QQ(\zeta_{43})$ is the splitting field of the cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_{43}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^42 x^i$, which is degree $\phi(43) = 42$ since $43$ is prime.

Moreover, the Galois group is isomorphic to $\ZZ_{43}\units \cong \ZZ_{42}$.

### Part 3

Since proper subfields will correspond to intermediate extensions which will correspond to subgroups of the Galois group, this problem is reduced to counting the number of distinct subgroups of $\ZZ_{42}$.
This is a cyclic group, so there is exactly one subgroup of order $d$ for each $d$ dividing 42. Since $42 = 2*3*7$, we have

- A subgroup of order 2, corresponding to a field extension of degree 21,
- A subgroup of order 3, corresponding to a field extension of degree 14,
- A subgroup of order 6, corresponding to a field extension of degree 7,
- A subgroup of order 7, corresponding to a field extension of degree 6,
- A subgroup of order 14, corresponding to a field extension of degree 3,
- A subgroup of order 21, corresponding to a field extension of degree 2.

## Problem 2

### Part 1

A splitting field of $f$ over $F$ is an extension $L \geq F$ that contains every root of $f$, so that $f$ can be decomposed as a product of linear factors i.e. $f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{\deg f} (x-\alpha_i)^{m_i}$ in $L[x]$.

### Part 2

If $E \geq F$ is a finite extension, then it is algebraic and $E = F[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n]$. 
So we can let $g(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-\alpha_i)$. 
By construction, each $\alpha_i$ is a root, and so $E$ is a splitting field for $g$.

### Part 3

Since $E$ was shown to be a splitting field, it only remains to show that it is separable.
But this follows from the fact that each $\alpha_i$ is a separable *element*, since their minimal polynomial over $F$ is $g$.
So $E$ is a Galois extension.

## Problem 3

### Part 1

False: take $K \leq L \leq M$ as $\QQ \leq \QQ(\sqrt[3]2) \leq \QQ(\sqrt[3]2, \zeta_3)$. 
Then $M$ is the splitting field of $x_3-2$, and in characteristic zero is thus Galois.
But $L$ is not the splitting field of any irreducible polynomial in $\QQ[x]$, so it is *not* Galois.

### Part 2

This is true. By the Galois correspondence, it suffices to show that $H \definedas \Gal(M/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G \definedas \Gal(M/ K)$. 
To that end, let $\phi \in G$, so $\phi: M \to M$ is a lift of $\id_K$. 
Then $H \normal G$ iff $\phi H \phi\inv = H$.
Letting $\sigma \in H$, we need to show that 
$$
(\phi\inv \circ \sigma \circ \phi)(L) = L,
$$ 
i.e. that this composition is some automorphism of $M$ that fixes $L$.

Consider how this acts on elements of $L$. If $\ell \in L$, then $\ell = \sum k_i \ell_i$ since $L$ is a finite-degree extension, thus algebraic, thus spanned by some basis $\ell_i \in L$ as a vector space over $K$.

In particular, since $\phi$ is some $M\dash$automorphism, it restricts to an $L\dash$automorphism, which must send each $\ell_i$ to some conjugate $\ell_i'$.
Similarly, $\phi\inv(\ell_i') = \ell_i$.

We thus have 
\[
\begin{align*}
(\phi\inv \sigma \phi)(a) &=
(\phi\inv \sigma \phi)(\sum k_i \ell_i) \\
&= (\phi\inv \sigma)(\sum k_i \phi(\ell_i)) \\
&= (\phi\inv \sigma)(\sum k_i \ell_i') \\
&= (\phi\inv)(\sum k_i \sigma(\ell_i')) \\
&= (\phi\inv)(\sum k_i \ell_i') \quad\text{since $\sigma$ fixes $L$}\\
&= \sum k_i \phi\inv(\ell_i') \\
&= \sum k_i \ell_i \\
,\end{align*}
\]

and so this composite fixes $L$ as desired. This $H \normal G$, which is what we wanted to show.
