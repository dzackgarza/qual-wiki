### Spring 2020 HW 3 #  1 #work

Prove that if $f$ has two Laurent series expansions,
\[
f(z) = \sum c_n(z-a)^n \quad\text{and}\quad f(z) = \sum c_n'(z-a)^n
\]
then $c_n = c_n'$.

### Spring 2020 HW 3 #  2 #work

Find Laurent series expansions of
\[
\frac{1}{1-z^2} + \frac{1}{3-z}
\]
How many such expansions are there? In what domains are each valid?
