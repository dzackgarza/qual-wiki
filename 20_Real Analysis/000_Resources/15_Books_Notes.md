# Books

- Rudin: Real and complex analysis 
  > Good general reference but the following books have more useful techniques

- Stein and Shakarchi: Real analysis.

	> Does not have $L^p$Â spaces.
	A good source for this and convexity is **Lieb-Loss: Analysis, Chapter 2**. 

- Stein and Shakarchi: Fourier Analysis.

	> This book is very elementary but more than sufficient chapters 2 and 3 are Fourier series, chapter 5 is Fourier transform. 

- Evans: Partial Differential Equations. Chapter 5.

  > For Sobolev spaces

- Shiryayev: Probability.

- Feller: An Introduction To Probability Theory And Its Applications

- Durrett: Probability: Theory And Examples
