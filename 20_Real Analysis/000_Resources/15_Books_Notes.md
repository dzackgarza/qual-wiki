# Books
- Rudin: Real and complex analysis is a general reference but the following books have more useful techniques
- Stein and Shakarchi: Real analysis.

	Stein’s book does not have Lp spaces.
	A good source of Lp spaces and convexity is Lieb-Loss: Analysis, Chapter 2. 

- Fourier series: Stein and Shakarchi: Fourier Analysis.

	This book is very elementary but more than sufficient chapters 2 and 3 are Fourier series, chapter 5 is Fourier transform. 

- Sobolev spaces: Evans: Partial Differential Equations. Chapter 5.
- Shiryayev: Probability.
- Feller: An Introduction To Probability Theory And Its Applications
- Durrett: Probability: Theory And Examples
- Good background notes: [https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/IB_M/analysis_ii.pdf](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/IB_M/analysis_ii.pdf)
