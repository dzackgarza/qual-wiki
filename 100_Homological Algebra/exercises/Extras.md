:::{.problem title="Weibel 1.1.7: Tetrahedra"}
The **tetrahedron** $T$ is a surface with 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces of dimension 2, and its homology is the homology of the complex
\[
C_\wait \da (\cdots \to 0 \to R^4 \to R^6 \to R^4 \to 0 \to \cdots)
.\]
Write down the matrices in this complex and computationally verify that 
\[
H_*(T) = [R, 0, R, 0, \cdots]
.\]
