## Unsorted Questions

For everything that follows, assume $G$ is a finite group.

- $H\leq G$ denotes that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
- $\size G$ denotes the *order* of $G$.
- $e$ or $e_G$ denotes the identity element of $G$.
- Multiplicative notation is generally used everywhere to denote the (possibly noncommutative) binary operation
- $G/H$ is the set of left cosets of $G$ by $H$.


### Cosets

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup (not necessarily normal).
  Prove that any two cosets $xH, yH\in G/H$ have the same cardinality.
	
	> Define a map $m_g: G\to G$ where $x\mapsto gx$, restrict to $m_h:H\surjects gH$, inverse $(m_g)\inv = m_{g\inv}$
- Prove the *fundamental theorem of cosets*: for $xH, yH\in G/H$,
$$
xH = yH \iff x\inv y\in H \iff y\inv x \in H
$$

> Use that $xH = yH\iff x\sim y$ is an equivalence relation (reflexive/symmetric/transitive)
- Suppose $\size G = pq$ with $p, q\geq 2$ prime, and let $H\leq G$ be a proper subgroup.
  Prove that $H$ must be cyclic.

> Use (and prove) the classification of groups of order $p$.
  
  ### Orders

- Prove Lagrange's theorem.

> Use $G = \disjoint_{i=1}^n g_i H$, that cosets all have cardinality $\size H$, and $\size \disjoint X_i = \sum \size X_i$

- Prove Cauchy's theorem.

> Induce on $\size G$. Assume $\size G > p$ and pick $g\neq 1$.
> If $p\divides \size g$, use cyclic group theory, so assume otherwise.
> Use that $\size G = \size G/N \size N$ so $p$ divides $\size G/N$, apply IH to get an element of order $p$ in the quotient.
> Then $y\not\in N$ but $y^p\in N$, so $\gens{y}\neq \gens{y^p}$ since $y^p\in N \implies \gens{y^p} \subseteq N$.
> Get $p\divides \size \gens{y}$, apply IH.
- Prove that if $\size G$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic
	> Assume there are two distinct generators and reach a contradiction.
- Prove that for every $g\in G$, the order of $g$ divides the order of $G$.
- Prove that if $\size G = n$, then $g^n = e$ for every $g\in G$

### Normal Subgroups

- Let $s\in G$, and state the definition of the **centralizer** of $C_G(s)$ of $s$ in $G$.
  - Show that $C(s) \leq G$ is a subgroup.
  - Let \( \gens{ s } \subseteq C_G(s)  \), where \( \gens{ s }  \) is the subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$.
  - Prove that \( \gens{ s }\normal G  \) is in fact a **normal** subgroup.

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup and $N\normal G$ be a normal subgroup.
  Show that $NH \leq G$ is a subgroup.

- Let $G_1, G_2$ be groups and $H_2 \leq G_2$ a subgroup.
  Suppose $\phi: G_1\to G_2$ is a group morphism.
  - Show that the image $\phi(G_1) \leq G_2$ is a subgroup of $G_2$
  - Show that the preimage $\phi\inv(H_2) \leq G_1$ is a subgroup of $G_1$, 
  - Show that the kernel $\ker \phi \normal G_1$ is a normal subgroup of $G_1$.
  - Prove that group morphisms *preserve coset structure* in the following sense:
  \[
  xH_1 = yH_1 \iff \phi(x)H_2 = \phi(y)H_2
  .\]
  - Prove the **first isomorphism theorem**: 
  $\phi$ is injective $\iff \ker \phi = \ts{ e_{G_1} }$.

### Symmetric Groups

- Let $\sigma = (4\, 2\, 1)(6\, 1\, 3\, 2) \in S_6$ in cycle notation.
  - Write $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles.
  - Compute the order of $\sigma$.
    What is the general theorem about the order of cycles?
  - Determine if $\sigma$ is even or odd.
    What is the general theorem?

- Suppose $\phi: S_n \to G$ with $n$ even and $\size G = m$ odd.
  - Prove that if $\tau \in S_n$ is a transposition, then $\tau \in \ker \phi$.
  - Prove that in fact *every* $\sigma \in S_n$ satisfies $\sigma \in \ker \phi$, so $\phi$ is the trivial morphism.
  - Does this hold if $n$ is odd?

### Matrix Groups

- Let $\FF_p$ be the finite field with $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime.
  Show that the centers of $\GL_n(\FF_p)$ and $\SL_n(\FF_p)$ consist only of scalar matrices.
  - Show that the scalars $\zeta$ that appear in scalar matrices $Z(\SL_n(\FF_p))$ are roots of unity in $\FF_p$, i.e. $\zeta^p = 1$.

- Determine the orders $\size \GL_n(\FF_p)$ and $\size \SL_n(\FF_p)$.

## Warmup Problems

- (**Important**)
	Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian.
	
	> Write $Z = Z(G)$, fix $x,y\in G$. Since $G/Z = \gens{gZ}$, 
	> $xZ = (gZ)^m = g^mZ$ and $yz = (gZ)^n = g^nz$
	> $g^{-m}x, g^{-n}y \in Z \implies x = g^m z_1, y = g^n z_2$
	> $xy = g^m z_1 g^n z_2$, everything commutes.

- (**Important**)
	Classify all groups of order $p^2$.
	
	> Must be abelian since quotient is cyclic.
	> If there's an element of order $p^2$, cyclic, done.
	> Else every element $a\neq 1$ must have order $p$.
	> Then $\gens{a}\neq G$, so pick $b$ in its complement, it has order $p$. Call these two subgroups $H, K$
	> Recognize direct products: abelian implies both are normal, $H \intersect K = \ts{1}$. and $\size HK = \size H \size K / \size(H \intersect K) = p\cdot p/1 = p^2$

- (**Important**)
	Show that if $H\leq G$ and $[G: H] = 2$ then $H$ is normal.
	
	> Index 2 implies partition into 2 left cosets: $H, gH$, or two right cosets $H, Hg'$
	> Note that $gH = G\sm H = Hg'$
	> Pick $x$, want to show that $xHx\inv = H$, so $xH = Hx$.
	> Case 1: $x\in H\implies xH = H = Hx$
	> Case 2: $xH\neq H \implies xH = gH$. Similarly $Hx \neq H \implies Hx = Hg'$, so $$xH = gH = G\sm H = Hg' = Hx$$
	
	- Suppose that the same result holds with 2 replaced by $p$ defined as the smallest prime factor of $\size G$

- Prove that if $H\leq G$ is a proper subgroup, then $G$ can not be written as a union of conjugates of $H$.

  - Use this to prove that if $G = \Sym(X)$ is the group of permutations on a finite set $X$ with $\size X = n$, then there exists a $g\in G$ with no fixed points in $X$.
 
- Let $G\leq H$ where $H$ is a finite $p\dash$group, and suppose $\phi: G\to H / [H, H]$ be defined by composing the inclusion $G\injects H$ with the natural quotient map $H \to H/[H, H]$.

  Prove that $G= H$ by induction on $\size H$ in the following way:

  - Letting $N\normal H$ be any nontrivial normal subgroup of $H$, use the inductive hypothesis to show that $H = GN$.
  - Let $Z = Z(H)$ be the center of $H$.
  Using that $GZ = H$ by (1), show that $G \intersect Z \neq \emptyset$.
  Set $N \da G \intersect Z$ and apply (1) to conclude.

- Determine all pairs $n, p\in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$ such that $\SL_n(\FF_p)$ is solvable.
