# Week 3: Sylow Theory

[See the Presentation Schedule](https://www.notion.so/df531651418e43a9918f8d6c0cc0c706)

## Topics

- The 3 Sylow theorems
-   Showing groups are abelian
-   Classification: 
	-   FTFGAG
	-   Recognizing direct and semidirect products
	-   Groups of specified orders:
		-   $p$
		-   $pq$
		-   $pqr$
		-   $p^2$
		-   $p^2 q$
- Sketch a proof for each of the Sylow theorems.

## Unsorted Questions

- Identify $\Aut_\Grp(\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \ZZ/p)$ as a matrix group and determine its size.
- State the 3 Sylow theorems
- Show that a group of order $pq$ where $p > q$. Show that $G$ has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, 
- Show that any finite abelian group is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups
- . Assume that $G$ is a group of order $231 = 3\times 7\times 11$. Show that $G$ contains a normal Sylow 7-subgroup and a central Sylow 11-subgroup.
- If $L/k$ is an abelian Galois extension of degree $540 = 2^2 \times 3^3\times 5$, what are the possible Galois groups $\Gal(L/k)$?
	- Are there any intermediate fields $E$ for which $L/E$ is a quadratic extension?
