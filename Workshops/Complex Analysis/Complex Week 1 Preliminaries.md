# Week 1: Preliminaries


## Topics

-   Complex arithmetic and geometry, conic section equations
-   Uniform (continuity, differentiability, convergence)
-   Inverse and implicit function theorems
-   Green's theorem, Stokes theorem
-   Complex plane, Riemann sphere

## Warmup

- State the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
- Define what it means for a function to be 
	- Holomorphic
	- Meromorphic
	- Analytic
	- Harmonic
	- Uniformly continuous
	- Uniformly bounded
	- Entire
- What does it mean for a sequence or series to uniformly converge?
- State the Laplace equation.
- What is the Dirichlet problem?
- Discuss how to carry out partial fraction decomposition
- Determine the radius of convergence of the power series for $\sqrt z$ expanded at $z_0= 4 + 3i$.
- What is the logarithmic derivative?
- Find a  function $f$ such that $f^2$ is analytic on the open unit disc but $f$ is not.
