# Warmups

- State the axioms of a topology.
- What does it mean for a set to be open? Closed?
- State the definition of the product topology, the subspace topology, and the quotient topology.
- What does it mean for a family of sets to form a **basis** for a topology?
- What is an interior point? An isolated point? A limit point?
- What is the **closure** of a subspace $E\subseteq X$?
- What does it mean for a topological space to be **compact**?
- What does it mean for $E\subseteq X$ to be a **dense** subspace?
- Come up with 6 different topologies on $\RR^d$.
- What is a **separable** space?
- What is a **nowhere dense** subspace?

# Exercises
- Prove Cantor's intersection theorem.
- Determine if the following subsets of $\RR$ are opened, closed, both, or neither:
	- $\QQ$
	- $\ZZ$
	- $\ts{1}$
	- $\ts{p \in \ZZ^{\geq 0} \st p\text{ is prime}}$
	- $\ts{ {1\over n} \st n\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}}$
	-  $\ts{ {1\over n} \st n\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}} \union \ts{0}$
-  Prove that $\RR^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\RR$ for any $n\geq 2$.
-  Is it true that the closure of a product is the product of the closures?
	-  Is it true that the interior of a product is the product of the interiors?
- Find a space that is connected but not locally connected.
	Can there be a space that is locally connected but not connected?
- Show that for $X$ an arbitrary topological space, the one-point compactification $\hat X$ (with its corresponding topology) is compact.
- Prove that path-connected implies connected
	- Show that the topologist's sine curve is connected but not path-connected.
- Is every product (finite or infinite) of Hausdorff spaces Hausdorff?
- Is $\RR$ homeomorphic to $[0, \infty)$?
- Show that $X$ is connected iff the only subsets of $X$ which are both closed and open are $\emptyset, X$.
- Show that a closed subset $A$ of a compact space $X$ is compact.
	Does this hold when $A$ is instead an open subset?
- Show that if $f:X\to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is compact then the image $f(X)\subseteq Y$ is compact.
- Show that every compact metric space is complete.
- Show that a compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.
	Does the converse hold?
	- What property on a space guarantees that compact sets are closed
	- What property on a space guarantees that closed sets are compact?
- Show that a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is necessarily a homeomorphism.
