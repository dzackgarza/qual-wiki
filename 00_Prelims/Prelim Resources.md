## Topics

Topics: [[attachments/UCLA_Basic_Exam_Topics.pdf]]

    
## Linear Algebra
Finite dimensional vector spaces (over **R**) and linear maps between them – subspaces, quotient spaces, dimension, bases, matrix representations. Positive definite inner products, orthonormal bases, extensions of orthonormal subsets. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors for automorphisms. Characteristic polynomial.

References: M. Artin, ‘*Algebra*‘ (Prentice Hall, 1991), Chapters 1,3,4K. Hoffman and R. Kunze, ‘*Linear Algebra*‘, Chapters 1-6, (Prentice-Hall, 1971).

## Abstract Algebra 
Definitions of groups, rings, fields, and modules over a ring. Homomorphisms of these objects. Subgroups, normal subgroups, quotient groups. Cyclic groups, finite abelian groups (structure theorem). Ideals, prime and maximal and their quotients — basic examples **Z**, *****k*[*X*], rings of algebraic integers. Field extensions, splitting fields of polynomials, normal extensions.

References: M. Artin, ‘*Algebra*‘, Chapters 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14I. Herstein, ‘*Topics in Algebra*‘ (Blaisdell Publishers, 1964).

## Point-set Topology 
Open and closed sets, continuous functions. Connectedness, compactness, Hausdorff, normality. Metric spaces, **R***n*. Heine-Borel theorem.

Reference: J. Munkres, ‘*Topology, A First Course*‘, Part I (Prentice-Hall).

## Calculus 
Differential of a smoothing mapping between open subsets in Euclidean spaces. Matrix of partial derivatives. Inverse and implicit functions. Multivariable Riemann integration.

References: W. Rudin, ‘*Principles of Mathematical Analysis*‘ (McGraw-Hill, 1964)A. Browder, ‘*Mathematical Analysis: An Introduction*‘ (Springer, 1996).

## Complex Analysis 
Definition of holomorphic functions, Cauchy integral formula, power series representations of holomorphic functions, radius of convergence, meromorphic functions, residues.

Reference: L. Ahlfors, ‘*Complex Analysis*‘, (McGraw-Hill, 1973), Chapters 1- 5.**Real Analysis**: A thorough working knowledge of advanced calculus, at the level of the books of W. Rudin or A. Browder as listed under Calculus. 

## Additional topics 
Pointwise uniform convergence of functions, equi-continuity, *l*2, *L*2(*S*1), Hilbert spaces, orthonormal bases.
