# Complex Preliminaries

- Since $\CC$ is a field, $\CC[x]$ is a UFD.

:::{.definition title="Toy contour"}
A closed Jordan curve that separates $\CC$ into an exterior and interior region is referred to as a **toy contour**.
:::

:::{.fact title="Complex roots of a number"}
The complex $n$th roots of $z \da r e^{i\theta}$ are given by
\[
\ts{ \omega_k \da r^{1/n} e^{i \qty{ \theta + 2k\pi \over n} } \st 0 \leq k \leq n-1 }
.\]
Note that one root is $r^{1/n}\in \RR$, and the rest are separated by angles of $2\pi/n$.
Mnemonic: 
\[
z = re^{i\theta} = re^{i\qty{\theta + 2k\pi}} \implies z^{1/n} = \cdots
.\]

## Complex Log

:::{.fact title="Complex Log"}
For $z= r e^{i\theta}\neq 0$, $\theta$ is of the form $\Theta + 2k\pi$ where $\Theta = \Arg z$
We define
\[
\log(z) = \ln\qty{\abs{z}} + i\Arg(z)
\]
and $z^c \da e^{c\log(z)}$.
Thus
\[
\log(re^{i\theta}) = \ln \abs{r} + i\theta
.\]
:::

:::{.fact}
Common trick:
\[
f^{1/n} = e^{{1\over n} \log(f)}
,\]
taking (say) a principal branch of $\log$ given by $\CC \sm (-\infty, 0] \cross 0$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Existence of complex log"}
Suppose $\Omega$ is a simply-connected region such that $1\in \Omega, 0\not\in\Omega$.
Then there exists a branch of $F(z) \da \Log(z)$ such that

- $F$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$,
- $e^{F(z)} = z$ for all $z\in \Omega$
- $F(x) = \log(x)$ for $x\in \RR$ in a neighborhood of $1$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Principal branch and exponential"}
Take $\CC$ and delete $\RR^{\leq 0}$ to obtain the **principal branch** of the logarithm. 
Equivalently, this is define for all $z=re^{i\theta}$ where $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi)$.

Here the log is defined as 
\[
\Log(z) \da \log(r) + i\theta && \abs{\theta} < \pi
.\]
Similarly define
\[
z^{\alpha} \da e^{\alpha \Log(z)}
.\]
:::

:::{.warnings}
It's tempting to define
\[
z^{1\over n} \da (re^{i\theta})^{1\over n} = r^{1\over n} e^{i\theta \over n}
,\]
but this requires a branch cut to ensure continuity.

:::

:::{.remark}
Note the problem: for $z\da x+i0 \in \RR^{\leq 0}$, just above the axis consider $z_+ \da x + i\eps$ and $z_- \da x-i\eps$.
Then

- $\log(z_+) = \log\abs{x} + i\pi$, and
- $\log(z_-) = \log\abs{x} - i\pi$.

So $\log$ can't even be made continuous if one crosses the branch.
The issue is the **branch point** or **branch singularity** at $z=0$.

:::{.theorem title="Existence of log of a function"}
If $f$ is holomorphic and nonvanishing on a simply-connected region $\Omega$, then there exists a holomorphic $G$ on $\Omega$ such that

\[
f(z) = e^{G(z)}
.\]

### Exercises


:::{.exercise title="Injectivity relates to derivatives"}
Show that if $z_0$ is a zero of $f'$ of order $n$, then $f$ is $(n+1)$-to-one in a neighborhood of $z_0$.
:::


\todo[inline]{proof}

:::{.exercise title="Zero derivative implies constant"}
Show that if $f' = 0$ on a domain $\Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$
:::

:::{.solution}
Write $f = u + iv$, then $0 = 2 f' = u_x + iv_x = u_y - iu_y$, so $\grad u = \grad v = 0$.
Show $f$ is constant along every straight line segment $L$ by computing the directional derivative $\grad u \cdot \vector v = 0$ along $L$ connecting $p, q$.
Then $u(p) = u(q) = a$ some constant, and $v(p) = v(q) = b$, so $f(z) = a+bi$ everywhere.
:::

:::{.exercise title="f and fbar holomorphic implies constant"}
Show that if $f$ and $\bar{f}$ are both holomorphic on a domain $\Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$.
:::

:::{.solution}
\envlist

- Strategy: show $f'=0$.
- Write $f = u + iv$. 
  Since $f$ is analytic, it satisfies CR, so 
  \[
  u_x = v_y && u_y = -v_x
  .\]

- Similarly write $\bar f = U + iV$ where $U = u$ and $V = -v$.
  Since $\bar f$ is analytic, it also satisfies CR , so
\[
U_x = V_y && U_y = -V_x \\ \\
\implies u_x = -v_y && u_y = v_x
.\]

- Add the LHS of these two equations to get $2u_x = 0 \implies u_x = 0$.
  Subtract the right-hand side to get $-2v_x = 0 \implies v_x = 0$

- Since $f$ is analytic, it is holomorphic, so $f'$ exists and satisfies $f' = u_x + iv_x$.
  But by above, this is zero.
- By the previous exercise, $f'=0 \implies f$ is constant.
:::

:::{.exercise title="SS 1.13: Constant real/imaginary/magnitude implies constant"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and any of the following hold, then $f$ is constant:

1. $\Re(f)$ is constant.
2. $\Im(f)$ is constant.
3. $\abs{f}$ is constant.

:::

:::{.solution}
**Part 3**:

- Write $\abs{f} = c \in \RR$.
- If $c=0$, done, so suppose $c>0$.
- Use $f\bar{f} = \abs{f}^2 = c^2$ to write $\bar{f}=c^2/f$.
- Since $\abs{f(z)} = 0 \iff f(z) = 0$, we have $f\neq 0$ on $\Omega$, so $\bar{f}$ is analytic.
- Similarly $f$ is analytic, and $f,\bar{f}$ analytic implies $f'=0$ implies $f$ is constant.
