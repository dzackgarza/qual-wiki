# Complex Preliminaries

- Since $\CC$ is a field, $\CC[x]$ is a UFD.

:::{.definition title="Toy contour"}
A closed Jordan curve that separates $\CC$ into an exterior and interior region is referred to as a **toy contour**.

:::{.fact title="Complex roots of a number"}
The complex $n$th roots of $z \da r e^{i\theta}$ are given by
\[
\ts{ \omega_k \da r^{1/n} e^{i \qty{ \theta + 2k\pi \over n} } \st 0 \leq k \leq n-1 }
.\]
Note that one root is $r^{1/n}\in \RR$, and the rest are separated by angles of $2\pi/n$.
Mnemonic: 
\[
z = re^{i\theta} = re^{i\qty{\theta + 2k\pi}} \implies z^{1/n} = \cdots
.\]
