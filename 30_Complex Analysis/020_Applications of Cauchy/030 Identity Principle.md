# The Identity/Continuation Principle

:::{.theorem title="Continuation Principle / Identity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on a bounded connected domain $\Omega$ and there exists a sequence $\theset{z_i}$ with a **limit point** in $\Omega$ such that $f(z_i) = 0$, then $f\equiv 0$ on $\Omega$.

Recall that a point $x$ is a limit point of a set $S$ if every punctured neighborhood of $x$ contains a point of $S$, and any infinite subset of a compact set contains a limit point.

:::{.slogan}
Two functions agreeing on a set with a limit point are equal on a domain.
