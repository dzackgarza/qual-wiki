# The Identity/Continuation Principle

:::{.theorem title="Continuation Principle / Identity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on a bounded connected domain $\Omega$ and there exists a sequence $\theset{z_i}$ with a limit point in $\Omega$ such that $f(z_i) = 0$, then $f\equiv 0$ on $\Omega$.
:::

:::{.slogan}
Two functions agreeing on a set with a limit point are equal on a domain.
