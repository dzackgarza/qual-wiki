:::{.theorem title="Picard's big theorem"}
If $f$ is meromorphic on a punctured neighborhood $\ts{0 \leq \abs{z-z_0} < \delta}$ and $f$ omits 3 values at $z_0$, then $f$ extends meromorphically over $z_0$.

:::{.theorem title="Picard's little theorem"}
If $f$ is nonconstant and entire, it takes on every value in $\CC$ with at most one exception.
Equivalently, if $f$ omits 2 finite values, $f$ is constant.
