# Riemann Mapping


:::{.slogan}
If $\Omega \subseteq \CC$ with $\pi_1 \Omega = 1$ then $\Omega$ is biholomorphic to $\DD$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Riemann Mapping"}
If $\Omega$ is simply connected, nonempty, and not $\CC$, then for every $z_{0}\in \Omega$ there exists a unique conformal map $F:\Omega \to \DD$ such that $F(z_{0}) = 0$ and $F'(z_{0}) > 0$.

Thus any two such sets $\Omega_{1}, \Omega_{2}$ are conformally equivalent.
