:::{.definition title="Conformal Map / Biholomorphism"}
A map $f$ is **conformal** on $\Omega$ iff $f$ is complex-differentiable, $f'(z)\neq 0$ for $z\in \Omega$, and $f$ preserves signed angles (so $f$ is orientation-preserving).

A bijective conformal map $f:U\to V$ **biholomorphism**, and we say $U$ and $V$ are **biholomorphic**.
:::

:::{.remark}
Conformal implies holomorphic, and a bijective conformal map has conformal inverse automatically.
Importantly, bijective holomorphic maps always have holomorphic inverses.
Self-biholomorphisms of a domain $\Omega$ form a group $\Aut_\CC(\Omega)$.
:::

:::{.remark}
The bijectivity condition can be weakened: an *injective* holomorphic map satisfies $f'(z) \neq 0$ and $f ^{-1}$ is well-defined on its range and holomorphic.

:::{.proposition title="Cross ratio construction of conformal maps"}
Given any three points $z_1, z_2, z_3$, the following MÃ¶bius transformation sends them to $1, 0, \infty$ respectively:
\[
T(z) 
&\da {z-z_2\over z-z_3} 
\cdot
{z_1 - z_3 \over z_1 - z_2
\\
z_1 & \mapsto 1 \\
z_2 & \mapsto 0 \\
z_3 & \mapsto \infty
.\]
Such a map is sometimes denoted $(z; z_1, z_2, z_3)$.
One can use this to produce a map sending any three points to any other three points:
\[
T(z) \da 
(w; w_1, w_2, w_3)\inv
\circ
(z; z_1,z_2, z_3)
.\]

:::{.definition title="Linear fractional transformation / Mobius transformation"}
A map of the following form is a **linear fractional transformation**:
\[  
T(z) = {az + b \over cz + d}
,\]
where the denominator is assumed to not be a multiple of the numerator.
These have inverses given by
\[  
T^{-1}(w) = {dw-b \over -cw + a}
\]
and derivatives given by
\[
T'(z) = {ad-bc \over (cz+d)^2}
.\]

:::{.remark}
Using that $\Aut(\CP^1) \cong \PGL_2(\CC)$, there is a nice matrix representation if you act on projective coordinates:
\[
\matt a b c d \cdot \tv{z: 1}^t = \tv{ {az+b \over cz + d }: 1} = \tv{f(z): 1}
.\]
This yields a quick way of finding $f\inv$: invert the matrix and ignore the determinant that shows up since it just scales every entry:
\[
{az + b\over cz+ d} \leadsto \matt a b c d \inv = \matt d {-b} {-c} a 
\leadsto 
{dw-b \over -cw + a}
.\]

:::{.remark}
A very useful variant that shows up in applications of the Schwarz' lemma:
\[
M_{z_1} \da {z_1 - z \over 1 - \bar{z_1} z}
.\]
This swaps $z_1$ and $0$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that if $T(z) = {az+b\over cz + d}$, this can be written as the cross-ratio 
\[
T(z) = (z; {d-b\over a-c}, -{b\over a}, -{d\over c})
.\]
