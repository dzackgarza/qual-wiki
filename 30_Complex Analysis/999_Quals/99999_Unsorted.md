Assume $f$ is an entire function such that $|f(z)|=1$ on $|z|=1$. Prove that $f(z)=e^{i \theta} z^{n}$, where $\theta$ is a real number and $n$ a non-negative integer. 

> Suggestion: First use the maximum and minimum modulus theorem to show 
$$
f(z)=e^{i \theta} \prod_{k=1}^{n} \frac{z-z_{k}}{1-\bar{z_{k}} z}
$$ 
if $f$ has zeros.

Let $f$ be holomorphic in a neighborhood of $D_r(z_0)$. Show that
for any $s<r$, there exists a constant $c>0$ such that

For $s>0$, the **gamma function** is defined by $\displaystyle{\Gamma(s)=\int_0^{\infty} e^{-t}t^{s-1} dt}$.

-   Show that the gamma function is analytic in the half-plane $\Re (s)>0$, and is still given there by the integral formula above.

-   Apply the formula in the previous question to show that
  $$
\Gamma(s)\Gamma(1-s)=\frac{\pi}{\sin \pi s}
.$$

> Hint: You may need $\displaystyle{\Gamma(1-s)=t \int_0^{\infty}e^{-vt}(vt)^{-s} dv}$ for $t>0$.


:::{.exercise title="?"}
Show that if $f$ is entire and $f(z) \convergesto{z\to\infty} \infty$ then $f$ is a polynomial.
:::

:::{.solution}

- Set $g(z) \da f(1/z)$, so $g(z) \convergesto{z\to 0} \infty$ making $z=0$ a singularity.
- This is not an essential singularity by Casorati-Weierstrass.
- So this is a pole and $g(z) = \sum_{-N\leq k \leq 0} c_k z^k$ for $N$ the order of the pole
- Thus $f(z) = \sum_{0<k<N}c_k z^k$ is a polynomial.
