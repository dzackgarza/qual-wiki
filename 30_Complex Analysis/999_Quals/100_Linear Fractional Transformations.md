Let $C$ and $C'$ be two circles and let $z_1 \in C$, $z_2 \notin C$, $z'_1 \in C'$, $z'_2 \notin C'$. Show that there is a unique fractional linear transformation $f$ with $f(C) = C'$ and
$f(z_1) = z'_1$, $f(z_2) = z'_2$.

Let $f(z)$ be an analytic function on
${\mathbb C} \backslash \{ z_0 \}$, where $z_0$ is a fixed point.
Assume that $f(z)$ is bijective from
${\mathbb C} \backslash \{ z_0 \}$ onto its image, and that $f(z)$
is bounded outside $D_r(z_0)$, where $r$ is some fixed positive
number. Show that there exist $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb C$ with
$ad-bc \neq 0$, $c \neq 0$ such that
$\displaystyle f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$.
