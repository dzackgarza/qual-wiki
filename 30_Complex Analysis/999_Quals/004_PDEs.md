## Spring 2020 HW 1 # 10 #work

a. Show that in polar coordinates, the Cauchy-Riemann equations take the form
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}=\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \theta} \text { and } \frac{\partial v}{\partial r}=-\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta}
.\]

b. Use (a) to show that the logarithm function, defined as 
\[
\log z=\log r+i \theta \text { where } z=r e^{i \theta} \text { with }-\pi<\theta<\pi
.\]
is holomorphic on the region $r> 0, -\pi < \theta < \pi$.

Also show that this function is not continuous in $r>0$.

### Tie's Extra Questions: Fall 2011 #work

(1) 
Show that the function $u=u(x,y)$ given by
$$u(x,y)=\frac{e^{ny}-e^{-ny}}{2n^2}\sin nx\quad \text{for}\ n\in {\mathbf N}$$
is the solution on $D=\{(x,y)\ | x^2+y^2<1\}$ of the Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation
$$\frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial y^2}=0,\quad
u(x,0)=0,\quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x,0)=\frac{\sin nx}{n}.$$

(2) 
Show that there exist points $(x,y)\in D$ such that
$\displaystyle{\limsup_{n\to\infty} |u(x,y)|=\infty}$.
