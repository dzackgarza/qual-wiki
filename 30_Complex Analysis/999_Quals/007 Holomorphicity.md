## Spring 2020 HW 1 # 7 #work
Prove that $f(z) = \abs{z}^2$ has a derivative at $z=0$ and nowhere else.


## Spring 2020 HW 1 # 8 #work

Let $f(z)$ be analytic in a domain, and prove that $f$ is constant if it satisfies any of the following conditions:

a. $\abs{f(z)}$ is constant.
b. $\Re(f(z))$ is constant.
c. $\arg(f(z))$ is constant.
d. $\bar{f(z)}$ is analytic.

How do you generalize (a) and (b)?
