# Schwarz Reflection

## Tie's Extra Questions: Spring 2015 #complex/exercise/work


(1) Assume $u$ is harmonic on open set $O$ and $z_n$ is a sequence
in $O$ such that $u(z_n) = 0$ and $\lim z_n \in O$. Prove or
disprove that $u$ is identically zero. What if $O$ is a region?

(2) Assume $u$ is harmonic on open set $O$ and $u(z) = 0$ on a
disc in $O$. Prove or disprove that $u$ is identically zero. What if
$O$ is a region?

(3) Formulate and prove a Schwarz reflection principle for
harmonic functions

> cf. Theorem 5.6 on p.60 of Stein et al.

> Hint: Verify the mean value property for your new function obtained by
Schwarz reflection principle.

## 7 #complex/exercise/work

a. 
State the standard Schwarz reflection principle involving reflection across the real axis.

b. 
Give a linear fractional transformation $T$ mapping $\DD$ to $\HH$.
Let $g(z) = \bar z$, and show
\[  
(T^{-1} \circ g \circ T)(z) = 1/\bar z
.\]

c.
Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic on $\DD$, continuous on $\bar \DD$, and real on $S^1$.
Show that $f$ must be constant.

### Spring 2020 HW 2 #  2.6.15

Suppose $f$ is continuous and nonvanishing on $\bar \DD$, and holomorphic in $\DD$.
Prove that if $\abs{z} = 1 \implies \abs{f(z)} = 1$, then $f$ is constant.

> Hint: Extend $f$ to all of $\CC$ by $f(z) = 1/ \bar{f(1/\bar z)}$ for any $\abs{z} > 1$, and argue as in the Schwarz reflection principle.
