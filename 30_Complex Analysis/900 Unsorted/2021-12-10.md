# Analytic Continuation


:::{.theorem title="Identity principle"}
If $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic on a domain $D$, and if $f(z)=g(z)$ for $z$ belonging to a set that has a nonisolated point, then $f(z)=g(z)$ for all $z \in D$.

:::{.example title="?"}
Since $\sin^2(z)+\cos^2(z) = 1$ for $z\in \RR$, which has a limit point, this holds for $z\in \CC$ as well.
