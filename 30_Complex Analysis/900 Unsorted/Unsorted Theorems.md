:::{.theorem title="Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem"}
If $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ except possibly at $z_0$ and $f$ is bounded on $\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0}$, then $z_0$ is a removable singularity.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Little Picard"}
If $f:\CC\to \CC$ is entire and nonconstant, then $\im(f)$ is either $\CC$ or $\CC\sm\ts{z_0}$ for some point $z_0$.
