# Maximum Modulus Principle


:::{.proposition title="Strict maximum principle, real version"}
Let $u(z)$ be a real-valued harmonic function on a domain $D$ such that $u(z) \leq M$ for all $z \in D$. 
If $u\left(z_{0}\right)=M$ for some $z_{0} \in D$, then $u(z)=M$ for all $z \in D$.

:::{.proof title="from Gamelin"}
The idea of the proof is to use the mean value property to show that the set of points for which $u(z)=M$ is open. Indeed, suppose $u\left(z_{1}\right)=M$, and express the mean value equality (4.1) in the form
\[
0=\int_{0}^{2 \pi}\left[u\left(z_{1}\right)-u\left(z_{1}+r e^{i \theta}\right)\right] \frac{d \theta}{2 \pi}, \quad 0<r<\rho .
\]
Since the integrand is nonnegative $(\geq 0)$ and continuous, the integral (5.1) can be zero only if the integrand is zero. Thus $u\left(z_{1}+r e^{i \theta}\right)=u\left(z_{1}\right)=M$ for $0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi$ and $0<r<\rho$, and the set $\{u(z)=M\}$ contains a disk centered at each of its points, hence is open. Now, the set $\{u(z)<M\}$ is also open, since $u(z)$ is continuous. Since $D$ is a domain, one of these two sets is empty and the other coincides with all of $D$. (See Section II.1.) In other words, either $u(z)<M$ for all $z \in D$, or $u(z)=M$ for all $z \in D$, and this proves the theorem.

:::{.corollary title="Maximum Modulus" ref="MaximumModulus"}
If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant on an open connected region $\Omega$, then $\abs{f}$ can not attain a maximum on $\Omega$.
If $\Omega$ is bounded and $f$ is continuous on $\bar \Omega$, then $\max_{\bar \Omega} \abs{f}$ occurs on $\bd \Omega$.
Conversely, if $f$ attains a local supremum at $z_0 \in \Omega$, then $f$ is constant on $\Omega$.

:::{.corollary title="?"}
If $f$ is nonzero on $\Omega$, then $f$ attains a minimum on $\bd \Omega$.
This follows from applying the MMP to $1/f$.
