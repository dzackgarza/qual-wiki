# Maximum Modulus Principle

:::{.proposition title="Strict maximum principle, real version"}
Let $u(z)$ be a real-valued harmonic function on a domain $D$ such that $u(z) \leq M$ for all $z \in D$. 
If $u\left(z_{0}\right)=M$ for some $z_{0} \in D$, then $u(z)=M$ for all $z \in D$.

:::{.proof title="from Gamelin"}
The idea of the proof is to use the mean value property to show that the set of points for which $u(z)=M$ is open. Indeed, suppose $u\left(z_{1}\right)=M$, and express the mean value equality (4.1) in the form
\[
0=\int_{0}^{2 \pi}\left[u\left(z_{1}\right)-u\left(z_{1}+r e^{i \theta}\right)\right] \frac{d \theta}{2 \pi}, \quad 0<r<\rho .
\]
Since the integrand is nonnegative $(\geq 0)$ and continuous, the integral (5.1) can be zero only if the integrand is zero. Thus $u\left(z_{1}+r e^{i \theta}\right)=u\left(z_{1}\right)=M$ for $0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi$ and $0<r<\rho$, and the set $\{u(z)=M\}$ contains a disk centered at each of its points, hence is open. Now, the set $\{u(z)<M\}$ is also open, since $u(z)$ is continuous. Since $D$ is a domain, one of these two sets is empty and the other coincides with all of $D$. (See Section II.1.) In other words, either $u(z)<M$ for all $z \in D$, or $u(z)=M$ for all $z \in D$, and this proves the theorem.

Let $h$ be a bounded complex-valued harmonic function on a domain $D$. If $|h(z)| \leq M$ for all $z \in D$, and $\left|h\left(z_{0}\right)\right|=M$ for some $z_{0} \in D$, then $h(z)$ is constant on $D$.
:::

:::{.proof title="from Gamelin"}
This can be derived easily from the real version of the strict maximum principle. We replace $h(z)$ by $\lambda h(z)$ for an appropriate unimodular constant $\lambda$, and we can assume that $h\left(z_{0}\right)=M$. Let $u(z)=\operatorname{Re} h(z)$. Then $u(z)$ is a harmonic function on $D$ that attains its maximum at $z_{0}$. By the strict maximum principle for real-valued harmonic functions, $u(z)=M$ for all $z \in D$. Since $|h(z)| \leq M$ and $\operatorname{Re} h(z)=M$, we must have $\operatorname{Im} h(z)=0$ for $z \in D$. Hence $h(z)$ is constant on $D$.

:::{.corollary title="Maximum Modulus" ref="MaximumModulus"}
Let $h(z)$ be a complex-valued harmonic function on a bounded domain $D$ such that $h(z)$ extends continuously to the boundary $\partial D$ of $D .$ If $|h(z)| \leq M$ for all $z \in \partial D$, then $|h(z)| \leq M$ for all $z \in D$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Use the extreme value theorem: a continuous function on a compact space attains a maximum absolute value.
But then if $h$ attains its maximum modulus, by the strict maximum principle above, $h$ is constant.
:::

:::{.corollary title="?"}
If $f$ is nonzero on $\Omega$, then $f$ attains a minimum on $\bd \Omega$.
This follows from applying the MMP to $1/f$.

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Show that if $f$ is holomorphic on $\DD\smz$ and $\abs{f(z)} \leq \log\qty{1\over \abs{z}}$, then $f\equiv 0$.

- Claim: $f$ has a removable singularity at $z_0=0$.
- Thus $f$ extends to some holomorphic $F$ defined on $\DD$.
- By continuity, $\abs{F}$ satisfies the same inequality as $f$.
- Now $\lim_{\abs z \to 1}\abs{F(z)}\leq \lim_{\abs z\to 1} \log\qty{1\over \abs{z}} = 0$, so by the MMP on $\DD$, $F\equiv 0$ on $\DD\smz$.
