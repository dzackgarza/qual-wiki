# Removable Singularities 


:::{.theorem title="Riemann's removable singularity theorem"}
If $z_0$ is an isolated singularity of $f(z)$ and $\abs{f(z)}$ is bounded near $z_0$, then $z_0$ is removable.

:::{.remark}
Showing a singularity $z_0$ of $f$ is removable: it suffices to show $\lim_{z\to z_0} (z-z_0)f(z) = 0$
